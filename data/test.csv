As the recent reverter has not provided here his reasons I have restored the deleted material my own reasons being amply covered above To address the last two comments preceding this one a I have no issue with removing the fan fiction link but need more of a sense of the views of the Wiki community before I acquiesce as I think it useful to those who seek out this page for a comprehensive view of what is available in the contemporary Tom Swift world b referring now not to the link but just to the language in the text that mentions sites and fan fiction you have discussed your opinions of my presumed motives but not whether the text itself is useful accurate and relevant c such phrasing as attempt to justify total violation vanity site doesn t like to play by them merits or lack thereof are uncivil personally abusive and fall short of Wiki s asume good faith policy I do not regard reverted by numerous editors to be an accurate characterization Scott Dickerson,0

your first reversion claimed an edit war But exactly this I tried to avoid I did not reinsert the unreferenced part 2nd deletion of Kmhkmh and moved the questioned addition of the lead totally into the footnote section Sorry but you are badly mistaken in judgment in this case It would be nice if you place your 2nd reversion which I still did not undo to the appropriate place showing CONSTRUCTIVELY working on an improvement,0
I m not surprised scritch was removed since the description given there is misleading at best The majority of scritches which spelling is much more common than skritch I d say have no yiffy aspect and have nothing to do with erogenous zones As for babyfur that article already mentions the main furry article in its See also section,0

The law school clarification was helpful the Boston Globe article just said something to the effect of getting her training and was fuzzy that it was the law school though that was implied I did not want to exceed what the source material said but this clarificaation is useful That said I d hardly call Rutgers a second tier school it is a fine law school with a good reputation,0

By my count he has not yet violated the letter of wp 3rr and I hope he understands it s important to discuss and build a consensus for his edits rather than revert further That being said I do believe it is disruptive to apparently attempt to circumvent wp blp and consensus by making the same edits here that he was advised to not yet make at Sarah Palin Finally while I recognize your feelings on the matter it s best to give other editors every benefit of the doubt and I ve refactored a couple of things in this thread along those lines Let s move forward from here aka justen,0

To be valid at 45 degrees the duration of the time unit has to equal one but that duration is not that of the second The current SI definition for the speed of light is just that a definition which provides a reference numeric value for everyone to use The Euclidean definition provides a numeric value with near unlimited precision The dimension set that was identified in an old document was 47 713 cm at 26 25400 degrees there was a scaling factor The old document did not express this in centimeters but I use centimeters so others will not have to convert the value Once I recognized that the dimension represented a wavelength it was then finding the mathematical form that represented the general case I was astounded by how much technical and mathematical information was expressed by that simple dimension I was also astounded that somebody over a century ago knew how to express that technical information in that form let alone knowing the 21 cm wavelength The author that recorded the information did not have a clue as to what it meant The only thing original in Euclidean Natural Units is substituting wavelengths and frequencies as values in a right triangle Wavelengths frequencies and triangles are already defined it was just a matter of implementing these relationships in a mathematical form There is no process to describe this form of substition and it seemed logical to assign the name that fits the geometric form because it s original research it might also be crap WP does have standards even though it is still heavily criticized for being unreliable In practice the only thing original is substituting wavelengths and frequencies for the elements of a right triangle i asked 3 times other than an allusion to the speed of light you mentioned nothing about what physical constants get normalized or set to a known quantity with these so called natural units i don t think that you understand the topic matter and are unable to make a real contribution because you just show no evidence that you understand what this is,0

The Baseball uniform images can NOT be replaced Do you want me to build a time machine and go back to take pictures Most of the baseball team sites use the pictures from the hall of fame which are also widely available on multiple different baseball websites Using them in no way affects the hall of fame or detracts from the images I was attempting to show the different uniforms on the season pages this is a fair use of these images I strongly disagree with your assesment that their is some other way to show the same information I do not understand why you would be so concerned with this as to disrupt a project I have been spending some time working on the season pages Wouldn t your time be better spent working on your own articles,0

I m getting the impression that progress isn t being made here It took about 6 7 hours to research and write that summary above it will take half that time for me to do justice to a lede and a body section covering this issue The reason I spent time and energy on the subject was because the answer wasn t simple I suspect that my summation will neither make Gabe nor Malik happy because my tentative conclusion on the basis of the sources I read is that Haley was treated like a ghostwriter at the time He expended energy to minimize his own voice he signed a contract to nominally limit his authorial discretion in favor of what looked like verbatim copy and he accepted credit which looks a lot like how ghostwriters are credited when they are credited However this view of Haley as ghostwriter is a deliberate narrative construction of Malcolm X and contemporary black scholars who wanted to see the book as a singular creation of a dynamic leader and martyr It is not borne out by a detailed read of the autobiography or the full relationship between the two men which is best described as a collaboration Haley exercised discretion guided Malcolm in critical stylistic and rhetorical moments and compiled the work I m taking pains to point this out now because even though I could write the body and the lede it wouldn t be mine This RfC would not reach a satisfactory conclusion and I would have wasted my time if I left you with a block of text which will be riddled with grammatical errors which neither editor could modify without creating another dust up So I m going to make a blunt statement I feel both Malik and Gabe s views of the authorship question are wrong and my conclusions repudiate both views in part Can both sides accept this as a content starting point rather than re fighting the rather boring and unenlightening question of who the sole author of the book is based on what the inside jacket says IF the answer to all those questions is no then I am going to step away from the article and recommend you guys seek formal mediation Because the only way to resolve this dispute appropriately would be to impose an outcome,0
Good point Never heard of him before seeing this page Frankly it appears that conspiracy theories may be the primary rationale behind any notability Which is to say if not for his predilection for such why does this article exist There do exist some RS in the article And although his own blog is primary it certainly makes the case Perhaps we should spend more time looking for more secondary sources And if we can t find them revisit the purpose of the article,0

Dreadlocke just put back the NPOV tag I start to think that we should point out the wrong behavior of Mr Skolnick to an appropriate commitee He scares away experienced editors such as which I am sure have not taken any side and just try to help us to have an NPOV article I am also very opiniated It is alright to have an opinion but one must respect the opinions of others not necessarily agree with them but respect them,0

I note that NOBS doesn t believe there is any evidence that the Rosenbergs were induced to confess and name names by the prospect of commutation to life imprisonment But Doctorow writing in the late 60s his Book of Daniel was published in 1971 gives this detail so the story must have been current back then,0

Zeno who is apparently eager to leave the implication that mainstream interpretations of Islam support OBL and view his activities I suggest you carefully read what I said instead of trying to put words into my mouth Nowhere did I imply are you are claiming I am implying I mentioned Osama bin Laden s VIDEOS as an example of how the Mujahideen use mass media to further their cause Whether or not you agree with Osama bin LAden s actions as if anyone really knows WHAT his exact actions are or were the fact remains that Osama bin Laden is an example of a famous mujahid a militant Islamist who went on Jihad On the one hand you and your coreligionists are all too eager to insist that there is nothing wrong about Muslims fighting against non Muslim invaders We know for a fact that Osama bin Laden was a wealthy young man whose belief in the ideology of Jihad led him to go to fight in the Afghan Jihad against Soviet invasion Clearly Osama bin LAden is a legitimate example of a mujahid holy warrior If you would like to discuss other holy warriors as well then feel free to do so The discussion of holy war and holy warriors is pertinant to the article on Jihad regardless of your extreme POV that it is not read in considerably more depth about this topic before trying to create any summary here or elsewhere on WP of What Muslims believe or What Islam teaches concerning Jihad This is a personal attack and is absolutely unacceptable If you wish you my argue against my statements how ever you may not resort to argumentum ad hominem You have no right or reason to insinuate that I have not adequetly studied the Islamic religion I suggest you conduct yourself in a manner that is not contrary to Wikipedia policies Finally Zeno if you have some specific reason for advocating that the most militant deviant and destructive aspects of Islamic thought should be bolted forcibly into the body of this article as though they were mainstream beliefs I would like to encourage you to explain to us what that reason is Refer explictly to which statement you are referring Your claims about what i have said are erroneous and you have not provided any evidence to support your claims There is no mystery as to why you have failed to support said claims Would you write an article on the Just war theory within Christianity by citing as representative of Christian recruitment and public discussion the writings of Eric Robert Rudolph and Christian Identity Please provide a list of contemporary Islamic holy warriors whom you believe are resprestative of Jihad,0

NUMB3RN7NE I expect you will be accused of debating for pointing out an error It was cherry picked from an old article What I propose is a piece taken from Engineering News I propose this portion of the lede is removed Rossi and Focardi say the device works by infusing heated hydrogen into nickel transmuting it into copper and producing heat 9 10 An international patent application 1 has received an unfavorable international preliminary report on patentability because it seemed to offend against the generally accepted laws of physics and established theories and to overcome this problem the application should have contained either experimental evidence or a firm theoretical basis in current scientific theories 11 The device has been demonstrated to invited audiences several times and commented on by various academics and others but no independent tests have been reported by sources independent of Rossi and no peer reviewed tests have been reported in scientific publications Steve Featherstone wrote in Popular Science that by the summer of 2012 Rossi s outlandish claims for the E Cat seemed thoroughly debunked and that Rossi looked like a con man clinging to his story to the bitter end 12 And replaced by this taken from Engineering News Rossi allowed third party investigators to test an improved version of the E Cat unit he first demonstrated in October 2011 called the Hot Cat or E Cat HT where HT indicates high temperature The evaluation was performed by seven scientists Giuseppe Levi of Bologna University Evelyn Foschi of Bologna Torbj rn Hartman Bo H istad Roland Pettersson and Lars Tegn r of Upssala University in Sweden and Hanno Ess n of Sweden s Royal Institute of Technology Their 29 page report titled Indication of anomalous heat energy production in a reactor device containing hydrogen loaded nickel powder was originally posted on May 6 on Cornell University s scientific archive website at A revised version was uploaded four days later but it should be noted that the paper has not yet been through a scientific peer review process and so its findings should be regarded as provisional The authors were careful with their use of the word indication rather than proof Two separate tests were performed on the E Cat HT one in December 2012 which lasted 96 hours and another in March which tested an improved prototype running continuously for 116 hours The scientists used a thermal imaging camera to quantify the heat output of the E Cat HT together with electronic equipment to measure the electrical power input that kick starts the reaction Both tests yielded evidence of so called anomalous heat production in decidedly higher quantities than what may be gained from any conventional energy source More strikingly the authors conclude that volumetric and gravimetric energy densities were found to be far above those of any known chemical source They state further that even by the most conservative assumptions as to the errors in the measurements the result is still one order of magnitude ten times greater than conventional energy sources Some commentators maintain that the test might somehow have been rigged by Rossi for example by hiding an additional source of electrical energy input In follow up comments on the Web the authors of the report say this is very unlikely Ref Adrian Ashfield,0

Having seen this appear on the Admins noticeboard I thought I would add my 2p There seems no reason to include the paragraph Miliband is not his grandfather and he is in no way compelled to publicly denounce his ideology A couple of comments to Hereward77 Just because a paragraph has been in place for a year does not mean it is ok plenty of mistakes POV pushing etc have been left in articles for long periods of time before being corrected it is certainly not censorship Secondly you seem to be very much against the Labour Party so I suggest you try to control your obvious antipathy towards them or desist from editing related articles Regards,0
I am not convinced that Ayyavazhi deserves a separate mention I believe this may be giving undue weight to the POV that Ayyavazhi is a separate religion First I am not convinced that the majority of followers of Ayyavazhi consider themselves to be a separate religion There is a vocal editor who believes so but websites devoted to Ayyavazhi seem to contradict him Second it is not uncommon for a sect to hold the views that Hindus have religiously gone astray The founder of the sect is an avatar of god The founder has provided new teachings which restore the original essence of Hinduism Thus although followers of Ayyavazhi may and I m not asserting the majority do believe Ayyavazhi to be a separate religion this POV is not necessarily the only one that should be considered in Wikipedia or even given the greatest weight Unfortunately discussions on this subject tend to be extremely voluminous and not very fruitful I would very much like to avoid long discussions about Ayyavazhi on every page in which it is mentioned and would be grateful for suggestions regarding how to proceed,0
The edit summary did not say why you were removing the reference So I restored the reference I don t think I was uncivil but if you d like me to be I know how You clearly have a dynamic IP which makes it nearly impossible to communicate with you I find being intentionally hard to communicate with a problem that impedes improving Wikipedia Persisting in editing Wikipedia without a reliably static talk page when you know this can be a problem which can be easily resolved by registering just seems plain inconsiderate And I respond to such intentional inconsideration poorly Too bad ain t it Buzz off and whine about how you should be treated the same as a registered user to somebody else I don t buy it and never have In the future please use the talk page of the article involved rather than mine since you don t bother maintain a static place to talk to you why should I entertain you here,0

For readability I switched back to the far left Jayjg thanks for your attempt to answer but you only state that the status is confusing and disputed But that can only be the case if there are different possibilities Why is it so difficult to explicitely state these Should I try some wild guesses and you answer yes and no It s becoming silly not very good for such a topic Nevertheless Possible POVs The Westbank is a no mans land like Antarctica or the Moon The Westbank is a part of Israel The Westbank is a part of Lebanon The Westbank is still a part of the Ottoman Empire,0
I still fail to see how the article is discussed A serious discussion according to Wikipedia would be to say in citation expert X says that it is impossible to test the second postulate because of problem Y Therefore we should reword the article to reflect the view expounded by X that synchronization is only used to mean two way synchronization I don t buy anyone s statement that it s obvious as a reference,0

The importance of these and other factors can also be seen when we turn to the closely related questions of how ethnies change in character dissolve or survive Let me start with ethnic change and with a well known example that of the Greeks Modern Greeks are taught that they are the heirs and descendants not merely of Greek Byzantium but also of the ancient Greeks and their classical Hellenic civilization In both cases and there have in fact been two rival myths of descent at work since the early nineteenth century descent was seen in largely demographic terms or rather cultural affinity with Byzantium and ancient Greece notably Athens was predicated on demographic continuity Unfortunately for the classicist Hellenic myth the demographic evidence is at best tenuous at worst non existent As Jacob Fallmereyer demonstrated long ago Greek demographic continuity was brutally interrupted in the late sixth to eighth centuries AD by massive influxes of Avar Slav and later Albanian immigrants The evidence from the period suggests that the immigrants succeeded in occupying most of central Greece and the Peloponnesus Morea pushing the original Greek speaking and Hellenic inhabitants themselves already intermingled with earlier Macedonian Roman and other migrants to the coastal areas and the islands of the Aegean This shifted the centre of a truly Hellenic civilization to the east to the Aegean the Ionian littoral of Asia Minor and to Constantinople It also meant that modem Greeks could hardly count as being of ancient Greek descent even if this could never be ruled out There is a sense in which the preceding discussion is both relevant to a sense of Greek identity now and earlier and irrelevant It is relevant in so far as Greeks now and earlier fellt that their Greekness was a product of their descent from the ancient Greeks or Byzantine Greeks and that such filiations made them feel themselves to be members of one great super family of Greeks shared sentiments of continuity and membership being essential to a lively sense of identity It is irrelevant in that ethnies arc constituted not by lines of physical descent but by the sense of continuity shared memory and collective destiny i e by lines of cultural affinity embodied in distinctive myths memories symbols and values retained by a given cultural unit of population In that sense much has been retained and revived from the extant heritage of ancient Greece For even at the time of Slavic migrations in Ionia and especially in Constantinople there was a growing emphasis on the Greek language on Greek philosophy and literature and on classical models of thought and scholarship Such a Greek revival was to surface again in the tenth and fourteenth centuries as well as subsequently providing a powerful impetus to the sense of cultural affinity with ancient Greece and its classical heritage This is not to deny for one moment either the enormous cultural changes undergone by the Greeks despite a surviving sense of common ethnicity or the cultural influence of surrounding peoples and civilizations over two thousand years At the same time in terms of script and language certain values a particular environment and its nostalgia continuous social interactions and a sense of religious and cultural difference even exclusion a sense of Greek identity and common sentiments of ethnicity can be said to have persisted beneath the many social and political changes of the last two thousand years,0

The IHH section is currently not a good summary of the IHH article Around half the main article is a section called Allegations of Islamic extremism affiliations Several groups have made these allegations as well as several media outlets IHH has close connections to Hamas These issues are relevant to this article None of them appear in the summary we have in this article which makes it extremely POV and not in line with WP SUMMARIZE I m open to suggestions on how to fix this,0

Editors should always be hesitant to change stable style without a compelling reason and clear support from WP MOS A personal opinion about what constitutes pedantic style is not a compelling reason And our Manual of Style may be interpreted to support either position on whether a year at the beginning of the sentence should be spelled out or expressed as a numeral So let s go to the real world The Chicago Manual of Style is clear on this matter if a sentence begins with a year it should be spelled out The practice of the leading American newspapers the New York Times and Washington Post is precisely the same sentences are routinely cast so that they begin with years and those years are invariably spelled out The latest improvement The year 1952 is redundant and clumsy and will be reverted in good time,0

After going over everything it seems a mediation really isn t required This fact is cited and as it pertains to Pi Kappa Alpha it should stay The editors disputing the fact being kept in the page were unregistered users and they have seemed to let it go If they were to come back and complain more then a mediation would need to take place but it seems that all registered users that have contributed to this dispute have all taken the same side of keeping the fact as long as it is cited which has been now for sometime,0

The simple fact that this proposal starts off with a vote on the day that it s introduced only shows that it s getting ready to replace the existing problem with more of the same The biggest need in an effective deletion system is admins who are capable of being sensitive to the interests of all parties in a deletion discussion All those with an interest in a particular discussion including rank newbies need to feel that their arguments are being heard This does not mean that everything they propose will be kept but they can at least walk away from a losing argument with the feeling that they may still succeed in future arguments This requires patience and humility on the part of those admins and the ability to recognize that the peace which comes from giving others the benefit of the doubt may be worth far more than the perfection that comes from eliminating an article of dubious notability I have no problem admitting that I sometimes act autocratically about deletions in Wiktionary and occasionally even ignore the wishes of the majority but there is no outcry about abuse of privileges Those against whom I act today know that tomorrow there will be other arguments that they can win Apart from some obvious no brainers I prefer to wait until at least seven days after the time of the last comment on a proposal before taking any kind of action Not only that but in all cases including the no brainers I prefer to wait at least a further seven days before deleting the debate This leaves an opportunity for those who might want something undeleted The process may be much slower but that s better than letting loose a hoard of junior Dr Strangeloves to impose their solutions 08 59 02 2005 08 02 UTC,0

copied from user talk by Thank you This is the first time I am using Wiki to edit My apologies for the confusion as I learn how it works This book is worthy of the futher reading category because it sites and researches the work of many of the authors mentioned in this category at wiki for quantum mechanics and mysticism as I have read on the subject It is also listed at the University of California Berkley Student Store as well as Amazon and all the major online retailers Here is the book description In an interview in 1989 at the Nils Bohr Institute in Copenhagen David Bohm spoke on his theory of wholeness and the implicate order The conversation centered around a new worldview that is developing in part of the Western world one that places more focus on wholeness and process than analysis of separate parts Bohm explained the basics of the theory of relativity and its more revolutionary offspring quantum theory Either theory if carried out to its extreme violates every concept on which we base our understanding of reality Both challenge our notions of our world and ourselves He cited evidence from both theories that support a new paradigm of a more interrelated fluid and less absolute basis of existence one in which mind is an active participant Information contributes fundamentally to the qualities of substance The early quantum physicists like Nils Bohr were ridiculed by those who could not comprehend the majesty of their attempts to explain our reality The debunker inductive reasoning which imposes direct inferential theory upon nature has caused a setback that science has yet to overcome Despite their stated fear of religion these theories are in fact doing what the Dark Ages did to sincere seekers of truth It was the dawning of a New Age which revived ancient Chaos Science Our whole computerized creative and productive world is largely a function of these atom mysticists I hope I am using the talk page correctly here I had somewhat of difficult time navigating my way around,0

Copied from the main article Could someone who understands explain why the set of rational numbers does not have property 4 Property 4 says that if you partition the set into two halves then there must be a boundary point in the set This is not true for the rationals take as A the set of all rationals smaller than 2 and as B the set of all rational above 2 Then all rationals are covered since 2 is irrational so this is a valid partition There is no boundary point in the set of rational numbers that separates A from B however,0

I m connected via modem right now and thus shall limit comments to what I can say off the top of my head In the UK people can and do distinguish between conservative and Conservative republican and Republican and so far as they are aware of the baleful concept and organization respectively moral majority and Moral Majority Meanwhile the Guardian like every publication working to meet tight deadlines sometimes makes orthographic slips Er you do as well And I probably do too You re welcome to point out what you see as significant errors and misconceptions by Wall but to extrapolate from these to a claim that he has no expertise in the field whereof he writes is quite a jump you thereby seem to be rating your own expertise in that field higher than the expertise of those that edit the journal You may be justified in this of course Of The good UK professor was writing a legal article as a Criminal Law Professor and diverted a small bit into American religion and American book publishing where he has no personal knowledge experience and academic training I still don t see anything about American religion at least in the part quoted before unless of course you insist that moral majority refers to the particular outfit headed by Falwell What the First Amendment allows and what is actually allowed are somewhat different I think you ll find that Favorite Son a work about the present Leader of the Free World was in effect suppressed later emerging from another publisher By suppression of course I do not mean instructions from any organ of the state Elderly was hyperbolic I meant retirees I have occasionally wondered why 141 goes to such extremes to add far fetched talk of bisexuality to the bios of US yoof stars of the 50s but I really don t care Also I m no long distance psychiatrist I just hope he tires of it Elvis s Wikipedia article isn t merely shorter than Madonna s I think it s shorter than that for The Emancipation of Mimi merely the most recent CD by the ghastly Mariah Carey an article that I rather enjoyed cleaning up a bit I ve no idea why amateur psychiatrists are welcome to discuss this interesting case,0

Well I d wait with any change there at least until it really happens But there s nothing wrong in discussing now what to do then I actually think that even if it breaks its ties with al Qaeda it will most probably stay one organization and almost definitely follow the same ideology and have the same practices as before Furthermore a break with al Qaeda doesn t make a faction more moderate as ISIL proves I actually extremely dislike the green colour since it s a clear euphemism of radical Islamist factions like Ahrar al Sham or Jaish al Islam For an uninformed eye it makes big parts of the map look like being in the hand of pro democratic rebels while it s in fact controlled by hardcore Sharia supporters Still in case it breaks into different smaller factions we would have to mark it as green But I believe that such a splitting is very unlikely,0

My history is not particularly relevant to your behavior and adding sources which don t back up what is cited And by the way I was accused of edit warring and sockpuppetry I never actually did anything that warranted being blocked And referring to the articles I ve edited as nu metal articles implies something that contradict what the sources actually say and not what you imagine the sources to say,0

No you have missed the point despite the fact it was already explained to you before Wikipedia is an encyclopedia not a research journal What we use is secondary sources not primary sources We do not engage in original research 41 primary sources do not carry more weight than modern commentary This article is currently one big exercise in original research,0
Need I remind you again that we are not talking about the legal definition of African American but rather commonplace usage Or are you denying again as you were earlier that commonplace usage has anything to do with history with slavery and the middle passage Or that even more remarkably the advent of Barack Obama has thrust such meanings on the term The term African American BTW was coined in 1978 by Jesse Jackson then head of Operation PUSH in Chicago at a time when back in Hawaii Barack Obama was still worrying about his SAT scores Here is Prof Harris again from that text quoted above Like other blacks in the western hemisphere the overwhelming majority of African Americans were brought to North America as slaves between the 1700s and the early 1800s Of the 86 articles in Encyclopedia Encarta that have African American in the primary or secondary titles articles like African American History African American Music Civil Rights Movement by African Americans Segregation of African Americans in the US African American Inventors African American Dance African American Speech Martin Luther King Jazz Blues Frederick Douglass Gospel Harlem Renaissance George Washington Carver and many more can you guess how much content is devoted to even the Black Americans of Caribbean heritage like Sidney Poitier or Harry Belafonte let alone the newcomers of the Kenya Hawaii variety like Obama Precious little Why do you think that is As for any suggestions above that I am but the latest Obama basher let me profess equally burning disinterest in the entire field of candidates that have been thrust upon us this election season The only reason why I am here is that the Obama article is an FA and I ve had an interest both in the selection and quality of FAs for some time It started with the FAs Louis Slotin and Western Chalukya architecture whose selection process I thought was defective and my suggestions for whose improvement can be found littered in the FA reviews Then a few days ago after re reading a year old interview with Jimbo Wales in the New York Times and after seeing him repeatedly pressed there on whether Wikipedia content was primarily authored and controlled by teenagers and by implication showcased that attendant level of knowledge I decided to pick a more current FA and that alone explains my presence here Again all I am suggesting is that somewhere in the lead something more specific be said about Barack Obama s status as an African American and therefore the claim of his being the fifth African American in this and third in that An FA needs that especially since African American or Black American are terms whose subjects have long and tortured histories It is not enough in a later section to pass the buck to another Wikipedia article Whos is an African American it has to be done in the lead albeit briefly and up front The topic is far too controversial to finesse and likely to become even more so in the coming months I will be happy to do that myself and with greater precision once I am no longer traveling and have easier access to the sources Regards,0

It is not that Grouchy was an idiot it was that with the most famous decision of his life he made the wrong one It is mulled over by military historians and is taught in military academies because it reinforces Nathan Bedford Forrest s maxim The first with the most Damn the fellow he is a mere pounder after all I am sure that if you read a French history of the campaign they will have an explanation for all the points your raise against the military genius of his age See Alan Coren Golfing For Cats for other similar opinions on things held by the French piles is I believe a favourite one Clearly such a military genius would not make mistakes like you describe so it must have been his inferiors who made them including Wellington and Blucher who were only ordinary generals The fog of war If only he had remembered to pack his drones Bonaparte would have know where the Prussians were As to your last three points they are debatable I think that here on the talk page you put far too little emphasis on Wellington s order for a general advance particularly given the way the British Army regiments was trained to press home an attack as demonstrated by Sir John Colborne s 52nd Regiment of Foot,1
I am not sure how I have been able to miss this intriguing comment for about a month therefore allow me to respond to a couple of the woefully wrong assumptions and assertions made in it as they perfectly illustrate how some editors are effectively leading our Wikipedia encyclopedia to overturning a scientific consensus that has been in existence for over 140 years an issue I do feel should be addressed First of all the results and conclusions in the scientific article I was referring to were based on an SSA study I am not sure whether you have ever heard of the SSA but in effect it is led by the American government as such the researchers in the study could base their results on information provided by the American government an organisation that I would think probably has more private and confidential information about its own people than most scientific researchers as well as amateur genealogists would ever have access to I am therefore quite confident that the presented percentage of verifiable supercentenarians at ages 110 111 is fairly representative of what can really be verified a word I am not sure you understand the true meaning of Second the SSA study was based on an entire census covering all inhabitants of the United States of America Thus it will not be necessary to also research school records local newspapers hospital records or whatever was implied as all American citizens were covered in the study Once again having to contact people was not necessary as the researchers had access to governmental information enabling them to have a myriad of source material to work with moreover their access to governmental information explains why it would not have been necessary to only focus on a small sample Third I do not understand why you are referring to the researchers as Young and his helpers this clearly shows you have no idea who participated in the research as some of the co authors included Dr Perls Director of the New England Supercentenarian Study a recognised authority within the field of age validation as well as Dr Desjardins a doctor in demography at the university of Montreal Implying that they are merely Young s helpers is therefore in my view a libellous comment to make and detrimental to your own credibility in this discussion as you have just proven you have no idea what and who you are talking about Lastly as your focal point in this discussion seems to be discrediting the GRG and or this Mr Robert Young I have taken the liberty to go to the GRG website and look at its list of publications go to click on Publications and scroll down To my surprise I discovered that this paper you are using as a source was in fact not Mr Young s first or second paper my interpretation of a rookie As such you juxtaposing his name next to the word rookie implies once again that you quite unequivocally so haven t got an inkling of what you are saying and or suggesting as you are not even willing to research your own assumptions leading to once again making a libellous comment about someone who has proven his expertise in the field Concluding if your goal was to discredit the concept of age validation and or assert the idea that the GRG is not a scientific organisation then I really have to disappoint you as you have only been able to accentuate as well as perpetuate the obviousness of your own incompetence in this discussion,0

Genesis creation narrative does not violate the academic consensus Genesis creation myth does Genesis 1 4 is narrative made up of two separate creation myths The article currently discusses these two myths as though they form one coherent narrative in two parts I like this euphemistic wording HiLo48 while I agree with you on the systemic bias issue I think you have your priorities wrong The principal problem with this article is not that its title uses the neutral word narrative rather than the equally neutral word myth The problem is that it is a POV fork of Genesis that promotes a fundamentalist theory of the origin of the Pentateuch as having been written by Moses on direct instruction from god rather than put together from several distinct sources some time after the 7th century BCE,0

Neuroscientist and others would this be a fair and more accurate rendition of the relevant sentence in the intro This diagnosis was the center of a major dispute between her parents Robert and Mary Schindler and her husband Michael Schiavo her legal guardian by court appointment and led to numerous court cases over the course of several years During the time of her care more than nine physicians are known to have examined her including eight neurologists All of the neurologists save one concurred in a diagnosis of PVS and six of them so testified in court the one dissenting diagnosed a minimally conscious state Ultimately a Florida circuit court presided over by Judge George W Greer held an evidentiary hearing at which he heard testimony from five of the neurologists as well as other evidence upon which he ruled that Schiavo was in a PVS This finding was upheld on every appeal both in state courts and in federal courts 1 July 2005 21 13 UTC,0

Exactly plus it has a lot less to do with where the individual members were born raised or live now and a lot more to do with where the band formed and the country they are associated with I imagine this is why the sources all state Australia Anyway if we simply go on band members birthplaces and where they are currently citizens of we d be looking at a Scottish English British Australian New Zealand American band and thus being ridiculous at the same time The point about the Bee Gees article doesn t really figure Articles are not required to be consistent across the board and I d be willing to bet that none of the editors who work on the Bee Gees article work on this one Your answer might lie in that rather than any kind of conspiracy,0
All right Koster states Twinking has come to mean a different thing in massively multiplayer games than it did on text muds Whereas in MUDs and MUSHes a twink was what is now variously called anything from a n00b to a grief player and then on EverQuest in particular twinking came to mean was used to be called powerlevelling or levelling someone most specifically by giving them equipment they could never have earned on their own In what s below I am using the MMO definition Koster then goes on to write three paragraphs about the MMO definition of a higher level player helping a lower level player rather than the lower level player doing everything themselves Also note that Koster makes reference to high level equipment most specifically This is the basis of why I modified the prose Secondly I must point out that a slightly different definition isn t a valid reason to remove the definition by EuroGamer a notable reliable source per WP UNDUE More than one opinion is allowable,0

to user EncMstr Well I hear what your saying but Sheela s page doesn t bear that out I notice you have only one reverted edit on the page could I ask you what way more interesting stuff you would be talking about and if you have any intention of adding any of it to the page It has taken two years and four months for the page to get to this state to user Cirt I have had a look at the Oregon article and see little or no additional material there that could be added Do you yourself propose to add some of the as you call it much more biographical material I find myself wondering that if as you say you feel that there is so much more to add to this what is basically a start class rap sheet stub why after two years and four months the page is still in this state I still assertain that this woman s notability is only in respect to the crimes in Oregon and that whatever is here would be better merged with the related pages For example of my rap sheet claim and the fact that apart from the crimes there is nothing else of notable worth the article ends like this she got out of jail 21 years ago and now lives in Switzerland,0
Once again this is the first time we have discussed these issues Further I have never asked you to edit anything I have posted Please stop inferring that I am someone else All it does is lower your credibility I am willing to allow the alma mater piece to stand however misleading it may be However I will continue to push the issue of the farm subsidy controversy as it is fact Most historical figures on Wikipedia have sections that list controversies I m not sure how you come to the conclusion that this is against Wikipedia policy I have even added a legitimate source as you have requested Do what you may but if you remove this section I will simply continue to add it back in,0
There should be NO heavy elements at the beginning of the big bang NONE but there are now observed early galaxies and quasars that do have heavy elements which fundamentally contradicts the big bang Edwin Hubble said that with no big bang then there MUST be a tired light explanation for the cosmological redshift So wikipedia should not ignore them but include published tired light models,0

Anonymous editor asked for a reference for the statement that Galloway had been a founder member of CARDRI the Campaign Against Repression and for Democratic Rights in Iraq I inserted a link to Hansard the proceedings of the British parliament for 14 February 1997 in which Galloway stated In the 1970s when my colleagues and I were founding the Campaign Against Repression and for Democratic Rights in Iraq Conservative Members sat on sofas with Saddam Hussein trying to sell him guns When CARDRI of which I was a founder member called for illegal violent action which some would describe as terrorist action to overthrow the Government of Saddam Hussein there would have been nothing in the amendment to stop a Conservative Attorney General taking action against us The anon editor has twice deleted this reference claiming that it does not refer to CARDRI This is completely untrue and there is absolutely no justification for removing this link to a speech in theHouse of Commons,0
Thanks for your input I m doing some cleanup to some non essential sections of the article but there s only so much you can trim It s a problem because the article is already bigger than it should and there are still two anemic sections Reception and Sales and there is so much to cover The Swapnote section is also problematic in my opinion since it s a little bigger than it should be yet I don t think it can stand an article on its own The Media capabilities section is another dilema so much to cover makes it way too cramped,0

It s now been almost 24 hours since you dropped this steaming pantload on my talk page and not a single apology or retraction has been forthcoming I guess I ll get my proforma apology now that I ve commented on it but let me summarize my response pro forma apology not accepted The only think that I will accept is you topic banning yourself from all climate change articles and discussions for a week,0
I agree with you that it may be generally better to fix articles one s self instead of just tagging them however in this article specifically the reason for flagging the article for a POV check instead of fixing the POV myself is that the topic is controversial and if I were to fix it myself what fixes I choose to make might be perceived as disruptive At this point I see that the toned down version of the paragraph is less POV than before but is it neutral now I doubt it however I still am not sure how I would go about fixing it completely so I have re flagged with a less obtrusive template in 2 spots The controversy section of the article Emergency contraception may be a useful starting point for fixing the paragraph permanently,0

They are promotional to the extent that the New York Yankees and the General Motors websites are promotional The New Thought sites are not literally selling anything Also New Thought is not a dead movement and the official umbrella organization is the INTA the first website so it seems only appropriate under WP EL Since you feel the second website is a bit sparse I ve included another one which contains much more information on New Thought Finally I d like to remind you against reverting a fourth time in 24 hours see WP 3RR,0

These are norms on Wikipedia I am honestly surprised Wikipedia articles are always encouraged to talk about the subject as it pertains to people across the globe and to use sources from a wide variety of localities It prevents systemic bias As for the academic papers you re likely wrong sometimes it takes more digging or paywall access but there s probably plenty of usable material As for a policy see the second bullet here and also WP RS MC This article heavily relates to psychological issues that need to be backed up by more than speculation and brash claims in newspapers and tabloids,0

Per Tryptofish s logic in the discussion immediately above it objectively describes one of the Museum s programs for attracting attendance particularly the kind of controversial attendance being described in the containing paragraph Further both the group rate still mentioned in the article and the one you deleted represent a change in AiG s position from 2007 when Ham said they would not actively recruit public school groups because they doubted any would come for fear of lawsuits Such a change in position is noteworthy imo Ham s 2007 statement of course was deleted as fear mongering although it actually came to pass just as predicted When the groups came and FFRF threatened a lawsuit,0

And this highlights another problem with the edit it s classic WP COATRACK General criticism about central banks belongs in the Central bank article Vaguely trying to tie it to the FRS by a such as the Federal Reserve monitary policies is a good hint about that So now you ve got another issue raised about your edit that you ve utterly ignored,0
I don t know why you re surprised It s a fact of news reporting that these things get pushed out ASAP and then don t get remedied But multiple sources exist in the article with 66 deaths yet have corollary information which is still true And in actual fact per the article no one knows if anyone survived so trying to claim some absolute truth is bullshit in any case,1

I read that book few months ago and then returned it to the library I think somewhere between pages 200 250 the author wrote something in that direction And yes you didn t actually said the statement in quotes but that s how it turns out to be And for the other article the creator of the page himself put thrash metal as a genre so you need to assume good faith If you claim it to be prog metal you ll have to find adequate sources but good luck finding them because such a thing review doesn t exist on the Internet,0

The problem for editors pushing for detail on this is that O Reilly s version seems to be pretty much correct It s like someone born in the 1940 s claiming to have grown up in India being called to task because he actually grew up in what became Pakistan O Reilly certainly didn t grow up on Park Avenue I suppose an O Reilly fan here could actually want the detail because it seems to vindicate him Nevertheless I think the whole thing is rather silly and most outside editors with no axes to grind either way would agree with me Way too much weight,0

This kind of stuff dosen t get sent around enough so the bad seems to build up and overpower the good I have always had a great deal of respect for your decision making abilities The case you tried to solve was a difficult and contentious one and I fully support you walking away from it without reaching strong conclusion You are a bigger man for doing so I tried to figure out who was right but also got fully frusterated by the intracasies of what must have been going on for years Please don t think less of yourself or let the slings and arrows of whomever is shooting at you hit You are a good and valuable contributor and problem solver,0

It seems that everyone agree with the prestige that the German influence related pictures have in this article so I think that we should also change the official language to German as well as it looks as if we were colonized by Germans What about pictures of Quilombos Pictures of streets of favelas Oh right they show a third world country and therefore foreign people will not visit Brazil and moreover the people who would be related to these pictures are less Brazilian than those german ladies Reading this article one may also think judging by posh office buildings shown that Brazil is like Dubai No contrast is being shown right in the article of a country with perhaps the most serious social inequalty issues in the world The emphasis on the pictures of beaches also endorses the jargon of Brazil being a land solely of Playas belas Not that they are unnecessary Brazil has plenty of playas belas but we should add pictures of universities Embraer workshops Alcantara Space Launcher or anything that could depict how advanced is Brazilian technology instead of filling it up with tropical scenarios Reality is harsh you cannot deny it pretending that here it s all about parties Olodum and beaches People may think that I am making a fuss about nothing but the pictures are what draw most of any user s atention while visiting an article many reading only the sections with the most interesting illustrations But there is no need for worries I shall not be replacing the current photos again I also send my congratulations to user Jo o Felipe C S for showing the world the real Brazil that I was unaware of He is so right that he added all these pictures without any discussion here first and I guess that plenty of Brazilians agree with him having not protested at all I give up then but I am very happy though because my country is so rich and I did not even know it Best regards From a Brazilian who seems to know pretty much nothing about his own country,0
Looks like someone found the correct tags If something negative isn t written I suppose we will remove the tags after an amount of time Consensus seems to be that there is not that much negative to write but that the sections could be reduced I personally cannot justify all the names of people and bands being included under public response but I could see most of them under public relations as they demonstrate the aim of SSCG in fund raising Also they are not really the public THe Governmental response section is not really about response either unless under the contraversial tactics section which is in fact what they are responses to I feel that it is possible that the editor who is placing the neutrality tags is not contributing to solutions You really must provide us with some negatives to include and please do not include comments from pretty people your prev message many pretty and famous people they are usually blonde and not that intelligible notable,0

In my experience the majority of white men who date Asian women out of a sense of fetishism are not fans of Japanese Anime I think the main driving force in creating and perpetuating Asian Fetishism are Western Cultural stereotypes that have been around for over a 100 years The average Vietnam war vet who slept with Vietnamese prostitutes during the Vietnam war didn t know anything about Japanese Anime And the white mobs that lynched Chinese laborers during the gold rush and Italic text passed the Chinese Exclusion Act didn t know anything about Japanese Anime either Anime as far as Western awareness goes has only been around for a couple of years while the prevailing stereotypes of Exotic Asian Women and Inscrutable Asian Men have been around for hundreds of years,0

I want what you want For the article to focus on the manga and mention the media thats directly related to it Idk if this is also what you want but i want to shorten all other complimentary media of the other series to the point where they dont get their own section unless directly related to the original manga Example PS video game and miscellaneous collections and instead be mentioned in it s respected series section because these series already have their own articles that cover that info Example SAC TV series mentions briefly of its manga OVA novels and video games i just reworked my rendition of what i would like the article to have,0

I apologise I was out of line But I was just trying to make a simple edit which had no bias whatsoever It was just stating that Evolution is not the only answer and that Ken Ham is not incorrect in his theory Just as creationism is a theory as is evolution Although evolution is the more widely accepted theory it is still a theory Preceding unsigned comment added by Creating artificial balance is a type of bias Assuming that one s own belief system must be valid and so should be given at least equal treatment with professional consensus on a topic is the definition of bias Creationism broadly construed is the religious belief that God created existence which may be compatible with science by not overlapping with it Young Earth Creationism is the rejecting of the findings of geology physics and biology that the world is more than 6 000 years old Old Earth Creationism accepts the findings of at least geology and physics potentially even that of biology Creationism is not a theory it is a doctrine Evolution is a theory in the senses that gravity is The theory describes something describes a facet of nature that has been documented When you say still a theory you demonstrate that you don t fully understand what a Scientific theory is,0

I like the shading for blue and red used in the chart immediately above but object to the use of a color that implies Warner Bros s announced intention to go Blu ray Disc exclusive in June is presently in effect So an even purple shade halfway between the red and blue used is my preference This can of course become blue on June 1st provided the announced event takes place Purple is good but it should be even The transition from releasing Blu ray Disc and HD DVD to being Blu ray Disc exclusive takes place between May 31st and June 1st per the official announcement Like the beginning of a new year the event has not taken place until the ball has finished its descent Unlike the beginning of a new year the prognostications of a movie studio five months out are uncertain Although it seems likely this will come to pass it has not yet,0

On the age of the Earth Darwin started with a very ancient Earth as put forward by Sedgwick and before becoming an evolutionist was convinced by Lyell s concepts of an infinitely old Earth While Darwin s calculations on the Weald were disputed and dropped by him in later editions this related to the rate of evolution and wasn t insurmountable let alone a return to the Ussher chronology If anything the need for speed contributed to the popularity of other mechanisms in the eclipse of Darwinism Note also that Kelvin s estimates changed over time becoming increasingly out of line with geology It s very debatable whether this detail belongs in this overview,0

Problem description The receiver uses messages received from satellites to determine the satellite positions and time sent The x y and z components of satellite position and the time sent are designated as xi yi zi si where the subscript i denotes the satellite and has the value 1 2 n where n 4 When the time of message reception indicated by the on board receiver clock is t the true reception time is where b is the receiver s clock offset from the much more accurate GPS system clocks employed by the satellites The receiver clock offset is the same for all received satellite signals assuming the satellite clocks are all perfectly synchronized The message s transit time is Assuming the message traveled at the speed of light c the distance traveled is For n satellites the equations to satisfy are or in terms of pseudoranges as section 4 beginning on page 15 GEOFFREY BLEWITT BASICS OF THE GPS TECHNIQUE Comparison of these equations with the Equations in R3 section of Sphere in which corresponds to corresponds to corresponds to and corresponds to shows that these equations are spheres as documented in Sphere Since the equations have four unknowns x y z b the three components of GPS receiver position and the clock bias signals from at least four satellites are necessary to attempt solving these equations They can be solved by algebraic or numerical methods Existence and uniqueness of GPS solutions are discussed by Abell and Chaffee When n is greater than 4 this system is overdetermined and a fitting method must be used With each combination of satellites GDOP quantities can be calculated based on the relative sky directions of the satellites used The receiver location is expressed in a specific coordinate system such as latitude and longitude using the WGS 84 geodetic datum or a country specific system,0

I have a question for Crockspot regarding the Counterpunch citation How does it contravene BLP to substantiate the claim that Hitchens drinking causes some to question his credibility with a Counterpunch article Agreed Counterpunch is a blatantly partisan source but for this sort of claim it seems totally reasonable in fact even the Cole blog is a reasonable source for that particular claim It demonstrates that Cockburn a widely known and well respected in some quarters source whose ongoing conflict with Hitchens is extremely well known and has been commented on in WP RS s questions Hitchens credibility The WP RS guidelines do not ban all such sources Are you seriously suggesting that Counterpunch is not a reliable source for the specific claim that Cockburn questions Hitchens credibility,0
First of all you are leaving quite a bit out That the essay advocated anarchism is relevant historically The article never says he believed it throughout the rest of his life Further scholars other than Rothbard have noted that Burke s style in Vindication was identical to that used in his other serious works which again casts doubts on his claim of satire But more importantly other anarchists were influenced by the work Godwin hailed Vindication as a precursor to his viewpoint One of Warren s associates reprinted it in 1858 with comments in the margin and Tucker praised and reprinted it in Liberty in 1885 I think that s more than enough to make it relevant to the history of anarchism And by the way the Athena comment was a reference to your name Telemachus,0
We don t know what the format will be or when the show will premiere Any act is easily undoable should MDP be a P SP clone Wikipedia is based on what is known at the present and shouldn t anticipate knowledge hence number of episodes in infoboxes are always as aired not the known number produced for exampl I think the most appropriate option right now would be to move everything to the Password page and off this page which by name is clearly for only those two spinoffs It should not have MDP on it If MDP gets enough information to support its own page it can spin one off In retrospect of the previous discussion This page is long enough without another spinoff unless MDP ends up being only a slight modification of these formats,0

We have a section on Language ethnicity and appearance Without the sentence you removed shown below in strikethrough the paragraph on ethnicity currently states Modern scholars agree that Jesus was a Jew of first century Palestine 246 247 248 Ioudaios in New Testament Greek a term which in the contemporary context may refer to religion Second Temple Judaism ethnicity of Judea or both h However in a review of the state of modern scholarship Amy Jill Levine writes that the entire question of ethnicity is fraught with difficulty and that beyond recognizing that Jesus was Jewish rarely does the scholarship address what being Jewish means 250 Without the struckthrough clause a reader is left confused by what exactly Levine is referring to when she writes of the question what being Jewish means,0

The conflation of plus size celebrities with plus size models remains problematic Countless straight size celebrities appear in fashion magazines Does this make them straight size models And more precisely does this make them relevant to an encyclopedic entry concerning straight size fashion models Are Britney Paris Hilton etc fashion models simply because they occasionally model clothing in addition to their other career paths Suggest that a separate entry for plus size celebrities who occasionally model but are not with agencies would be helpful,0
As you can see Dahn I m not making anything up Phanariotes is in fact used by english speaking scholars in the way I described above If you don t mind defocusing the article from Romanian history then it s fine by me we can stick everything in and share different sections Phanariotes in Porte Phanariotes in the Church Phanariotes in the philiki etairia phanariotes in Romania etc But if wish to have a separate article on the Phanariote period of Romania then we d have to rename I m looking for a solution that would be fair to everybody,0

The ancient galaxies and quasars in those two articles contain heavy elements which contradicts the big bang because according to the big bang only hydrogen and helium existed at that early time Heavier elements require billions of years and indicate that those galaxies and quasars are therefore billions of years older than the big bang which is a blatant contradiction of the big bang theory Tired light is the only possible alternative as Hubble admitted himself So Wikipedia should not be ignoring published tired light models and mention them in the article,0
Anyone can put a POV tag on it It can be removed once there is a consensus that the article is neutral Also simply adding positive content is not the right strategy One has to weigh positive and negative perspectives in relation to reliable sources not just in relation to each other,0
I think this quote is quite revealing 19 Feb 2007 Column WS54 Since April last year we have ensured that all nationals from European Economic Area countries who have received custodial sentences in the United Kingdom for two years or more have been considered for deportation This has led to deportation action being pursued against a number of Irish nationals who have committed criminal offences here Following recent discussions with the Irish Government I am able to confirm that the approach to be taken with Irish nationals will now be as follows Irish citizens will be considered for deportation only where a court has recommended deportation in sentencing or where the Secretary of State concludes that due to the exceptional circumstances of the case the public interest requires deportation In reviewing our approach in this area we have taken into account the close historical community and political ties between the United Kingdom and Ireland along with the existence of the Common Travel Area Those Irish prisoners whose cases are not considered exceptional whose sentences have expired and who are currently in custodial detention awaiting deportation will be released over the next week I have already asked that the necessary arrangements be put in place to ensure that these prisoners receive proper supervision on their release from the Probation Service The part about taken into account the close historical community and political ties between the United Kingdom and Ireland along with the existence of the Common Travel Area is politician speak for the historical pragamatism that recognised it was pointless deporting the Irish and a complete waste of public funds since they would always creep back in again I would agree that the approach to be taken with Irish nationals will now part implies that the practice was previously different ie that the irish were deported but I think that is just spin,0

I think it s time to whittle these two sections into a single smaller section and relegate much of the triviality to the appropriate subarticle Now that the Branchflower report is published there doesn t seem to be any need to imply discuss issues that were not raised as findings in that report It will probably be a big task considering how much discussion led to the current consensus,0

Let me help you out I don t know what game you are playing with the Kristi Noem article but it is simple matter of how to edit it If the traffic violations are a valid topic for inclusion in the Noem article then the traffic violations of Noem s opponent s chief of staff COS are ALSO valid for inclusion in the article Now if the traffic violations are not valid for inclusion then the traffic violations of the COS are not valid for inclusion An admin removed the COS s DUI conviction for the Herseth Sandlin article because the admin argued that personal articles are NOT the place for every tit for tat of the campaign Noem s traffic violations are only in the news because of the give and take of the campaignjust as the DUI of the COS So applying the logic of the admin working the Herseth Sandlin article to the Noem article then traffic violations should not be included Also there are BLP issues involved Do we want to put in Wikipedia the traffic violations of each and every person that has an article about them No Please review the BLP rules There is also the issue of undue weight Listing all of her violations one by one takes up a huge part of her bio Now you have been editing at Wikipedia for quite a long time now I have butted heads with you in the past You have given me the same inappropriate warning in the past You do not discuss the issues you just revert and then put warning above on my talk page From now on the burden in on you to DISCUSS Just don t tell people to discuss Start discussing It is a delay tactic on your part If this had been the first time that you gave me that warning then I understanding but we have had this exact same discussion Also I did discuss the changes on the edit summary And you know this I can tell by the way that edited my talk page The original warning asks that comments be left in the edit summarywhich I didso you edited the warning to remove the part about discussing in the edit summary Now unless you provide good reasoning on why either ALL of the traffic violations and that includes the violations of Noem and the COS belong in the article about Noem then I am going to remove the references to the traffic violations because they violate BLP and undue weight Now in response to your warning let this be fair warning to you that you need to start discussing issues before you blindly revert,0

Everyone is agreed that one of the key issues is the reliability of Indian rice production data Dewey appeared to have written the completely authorative study of this but I would not cite this until I had checked that it was not faked as so much academic research is faked evidence here encourages governments to adopt the same disastrous policies as those used in Bengal in 1943 So I acted strictly according to Wikipedia guidelines I spent some weeks finding then verifying sources he used I cited those I checked in the normal way and those I could not locate as cited by Dewey This is using a reputable secondary source to avoid cherrypicking and checking primary sources All Dewey s research not mine I also used another reputable secondary source the Famine Inquiry Commission report which reported a different set of statistical evidence given to it which happened to agree with Dewey and I checked that this was verifiable Again not my research Again not based on cherrypicked primary sources And so on with all my editing,0

I wouldn t be so harsh on some of these findings While they are not necessarily published in Western reliable sources it may be argued that there simply hasn t been enough research into this matter at all by such sources The word Ararat that is used to name this region of the world could be by no surprise the name given by the area by locals even though it may or may not first appear in external sources Hence the name may stem from definite root words in the language whether proto Armenian Armenian or appearing in both You shouldn t dismiss every Armenian explanation as pseudo this or pseudo that More research into this matter is certainly warranted though,0

I changed the description to Macedonian victory though with heavy losses Even though that s not a standard wording it describes the Alexander s victory defined as advancing his strategic goals accurately and also expresses what I think some of the editors want to point out that the Persians inflicted heavy casualties in the process Heavy unnecessarily or disproportionate losses don t make a victory Pyrrhic that requires the overall effect to be negative for the victor s campaign and goals due to these losses Here Alexander was able to achieve his objectives soon afterward in finishing resistance in the Persian Empire If you call this a Pyrrhic victory you may as well call Russia s ending of WWII by taking Berlin a Pyrrhic victory due to the losses it sustained or all of the larger battles in Virginia from 1864 5 for the Union before the Confederacy surrendered Pyrrhic also Finally heroic last stands and inflicting high costs are not sufficient to create a Pyrrhic victory just like the Alamo Thermopylae Isandlwana the Foreign Legion at Camerone etc are just normal victories for their bloodied opponents If there s a counter argument about how Alexander was less able to achieve his goals after this battle then I m all for discussing that but until then I m going to take out the Pyrrhic as plain inaccurate,0

Hi Vahagn For 1 according to Robert W Thomson who translated Moses of Khoren s History of Armenians Armenians began to call Mount Masis as Mount Ararat by confusion with the plain of Ayrarat which was so called as reference to Ara Geghetsik Ara the Handsome As you know another mountain that faces Masis Arayiler Mountain of Ara which is just above the Ayrarat plan is named after him too Here is the quote from Thomson Masis the Armenian name for the mountain south of the Araxes now called Ararat by confusion with Ayrarat the name of the province The Primary History Sebeos p 10 offers a different etymology from the personal name Marseak Footnote in For 2 here is what Robert Hewsen has to say In speaking of the mountains of Armenia a special place must be set aside for a description of Mt Ararat which Armenians call Masik a plural form probably referring to its two closely connected peaks or Masis the latter being the accusative plural but now the common Armenian appellation for both mountains the greater and the less The Persians aware of the biblical associations of the mountain call it Kuh i Nuh Mountain of Noah th Turks more prosaically A ri Da i Painful Mountain owing to the difficulty of its ascent Only Europeans call it Ararat Armenians often refer to the main peak as Mec Mets Masik Greater Masis and in the past they called it Azat Masik The latter form is often translated free or noble Masis but the invariable term P ok r Small Masik for the lower peak makes it clear that her azat must be translated high another meaning of azat the nobles being the high one rather than the free See,0

As the article stands currently NPOV is being abided by The heading names reflect the content of the headings and the content of the reliable sources I agree with some of Ckruschke s analysis but I disagree that removing the anti in the subject headings would make them more NPOV PnakoticInquisitor noted that removing the anti in the headings would make those sections sound less negative The purpose of NPOV is not to make an actually negative topic sound less negative or neutral Instead if article topics are sourced to reliable sources which indicate something important and negative then the heading label of the topic in the article should reflect that The reverse is true also if the article topics are sourced to reliable sources which indicate something important and positive the heading labels should reflect that Compare Contaminated soil to Water quality improvements Given that sources accurately demonstrate these topics in the article text under those headings these heading are preferable to alternative headings such as Soil description or Water description because they are more accurate Two circumstances would justify the removal of the anti in the headings 1 Requires that reliable sources stating the tracts were accurate in their treatment of the subject of the headings be included in the text under the subject headings 2 Requires other reliable sources be cited in the text under the headings which state that these other sources dispute the ideas published in the reliable sources currently being cited In either of those circumstances the headings could be changed to read something like Dispute over treatment of homosexuality in tracts and so forth for other headings If the section Anti evolution is not presenting all mainstream or fringe views with due weight reliable sources should be cited in the text that present the other views Then the article heading could be changed to read Dispute over treatment of evolution and creation in tracts,0

There is MUCH misunderstanding in your two responses above Firstly I would suggest a return visit to these professors The Plato Aristotle debates are fundamental to theatre history which my own professors for my MA and PhDboth in the US I might add and taught by distinguished etc did not neglect to explore with me in considerable detail FIRSTLYPerhaps it wasn t clear from the discussion above but MIMESIS and DIEGESIS are the Greek words That may possibly explain your professors ignorance Mimesis is translated as imitation or representation depending on your translation Diegesis is narrative or report This is why you may struggle to find direct uses of the original The translation was usually used The concepts however maintain regular relationships to one another You are right to suggest that the pre cinematic use of diegesis is obscure but that s not because it wasn t used but rather because it was translated Mimesis in this respect had a slightly broader usage but not much more The contrast report representation or narrative imitation is a major strand of dramatic theory through the ages see below SECONDLYRe the inclusive criticism in the first reply No you didn t follow Drama is different from other forms of fiction They report it represents epic poetry combines the two This is standard stuff As I suggested above consult Marvin Carlson s Theories of Theatre Dukore s Dramatic Theory and Criticism Elam s Semiotics of Theatre and Drama Pfister s The Theory and Analysis of Drama For example All due respect to your professors then but there is clearly a gap in their knowledge Diegesis explicitly does not include dramatic fiction which is why the second half of your first criticism above loses its way and misunderstands the nature of dramatic action in the cinema There is another separate issue concerning the development of the term mimesis if you return to your OED you will note two definitions in fiction that is RHETORIC from the M c16th and REALISM from the M c20th We are discussing the first sense The second I mentioned via Auerbach in passing His use complicates all this but doesn t have a direct bearing on this discussion THIRDLYI m not sure if this misunderstanding has arisen from one of my suggestions or whether it s part of your own background but you appear to be confusing the role the postmodernists have played in this development The post structuralists have engaged with representation or mimesis as well as narrative in various guises however I m not aware of a direct use of diegesis though that may be one of my own gaps The modern use of the term untranslated into narrative that is originates in film theory It is principally used in the Greek form as diegesis in cinema studies I know about the term from teaching it in my film classes I am able to contextualise its background and the critical history it joins because of my substantial theatre training It takes an inter disciplinary approach to appreciate the connection Without that it might appear as it seems to have to you that the Aristotle usage and cinematic are different and unconnected but that is not the case FOURTHLYre your reading of Aristotle I pointed to this very passage above when I said The epic Aristotle says combines imitation representation and narration I also pointed to the development of epic theater which precisely is to approach what you offer from the reverse direction epic poetry becoming part of imitation or more specifically the genre of epic poetry being articulated with the genre of tragedy to produce epic theatre still schematic though Now you say Unmistakably imitation can be a part of epic poetry which like motion pictures is reported to an audience rather than created in front of it The first part of this is true but actually the passage you quote doesn t say this Aristotle makes that observation a little later in the poetics where he identifies the union of the two as epic poetry But you ve misunderstood why epic poetry is a union of the two It is reported hence diegesis yes But it is reported by a human being in a live performance situation who during the course of his report adopts characters and speaks in their voice sometimes Hence mimesis The cinema can never do this well with the possible exception of The Rocky Horror Picture Show type events Remember that for Aristotle there is no live reproduced distinction since there s no such thing as reproduced action prior to the invention of the cinema it s all live Aristotle and the critical tradition that follows invoke a report representation dichotomy The poet speaks in his own voice Meanwhile on the other side of the forest or becomes the character by adopting its mask literally the use of voice or gesture Representation for Aristotle means live theatrical performance For the technical reasons offered abovecamera shot selection editingcinema is a report within the terms of that critical tradition It is for this reason that cinema studies adopts the term diegesis to describe its fictional world There s no humpty dumpty about it It s very clear and I can provide the citationsthe standard Bordwell Thompson Film Art if I remember rightly uses diegesis in some detail Uses I might add without discussing its theoretical history But for that go to the report representationi e English translations of diegesis mimesisdebates in the theatre history books given above I see that finds the word to be obscure Well all I can say is that its a basic term of cinema studies and pretty much every intro to film theory class is pretty likely to use it Its critical history and the way the term connects across disciplines it won t give you The reason why the two definitions offered in the intro of this article are in reality two different ways of saying the same thing you won t get in an intro level cinema class That such a history is a post graduate level subject however doesn t mean that it s inappropriate material for inclusion in an encyclopedia article If you d like the names of the worthy professors who taught me all this stuff I can provide them I have slowly but surely been gathering material for a citation drivemainly I might add for the drama and mimesis articles but it is relevant to all this toobut the theatre pages are in such a generally shoddy state on here that these high theory issues are a little lower on my priority list than basic theatre topics like Brecht and Stanislavski But the material is all out there in reputable and scholarly works I have no doubt many startlingly original and innovative theoretical ideas of my own these alas are not to be counted among them FINALLYI m a little confused as to why you say cooler heads Is your head feeling hot,0

They re still a few weeks away from issuing them out however the passport issue could become a very serious one I have no doubt some people are going to come on and claim recognition of passports is recognition of statehood and even try to argue for it So I think it s best to be pre emptive in this It s especially relevant because it seems Greece is going to recognize Kosovo passports and most likely other nations which haven t recognized in particular New Zealand and Spain It s also highly likely that other countries will not recognize their passports like Russia and possibly Bosnia Those recognizing its independence are almost certain to recognize its passports so having another category for countries recognizing their passports might be legitimate Of course this also is an issue extending to the article on the passport and the article on their foreign relations However at least this will provide for an important distinction in the article so its understood that not all those opposed to the declaration are like Russia and Serbia,0
The issue is whether or not the show implicitly states that Hal Garner is the next POTUS on screen it doesn t For all we know the next season could take place a month from now with Logan the current president in the show still in office or having him somehow escape justice alltogether It is that we just don t know specifically what happened to the character after the credits rolled We won t know until January 2006 or whenever the Producers spill the beans before then References to him possibly becoming president in the article which already exist in there now is good enough in my opinion for the time being,0

To the gay rights activist known as Adam Carr I noticed in your recent edits that you have a horrible penchant for editing away verfiably accurate information with imaginary claims cooked up in your activist mind But you should be reminded that good advocacy never consists of lying NAMBLA has never been an organization for male homosexual paedophiles It has never defined itself as such The self defined purpose and nature of the group is available for everyone to view Furthermore its membership has often included individuals who do not have a sexual attraction exclusively toward prepubescent children which is the definition of a pedophile Strangely the factual information surrounding Byrne s prosecution of the twenty four GAY men was stricken from the article yet none of the highly suspect yellow journalism included in the criminal allegations section was touched Could it be that your entire purpose for editing the article was not to improve its quality by incorporating additional factual information but instead was to misrepresent NAMBLA in an all too ironic demonstration of the modern gay rights movement s decision to distance itself from anything even remotely related to youth sexuality Be honest here,0

Your clich about extraordinary claims sounds good but is not logical All claims should be tested by correct procedures and competently run That is all Incompetent experiments like that run by MIT in 1989 are the problem They didn t bother to inquire about the requirements and not knowing them failed Reminds of the overconfidence of Park claiming he has never read a single paper on the subject but knew all the answers According to the New Energy Times he admitted LENR was real in 2006 Better late than never I m not challenging anyone s beliefs I m merely stating facts Others like AndyThe Grump may find that challenging to their beliefs but that is not my problem An independent third party test has been run This has been confirmed by Elforsk Forbes and Engineering News The seven professors who ran the test reported finding more than a magnitude of excess heat Way beyond any experimental error Those are FACTS You said In the real world when Rossi was in jail Not much doubt what you meant The Italian government passed a law that retroactively made the waste Rossi had collected redefined as hazardous He was found guilty but the small detail you neglected to mention was that he was later acquitted Typical ad hominem that are all too common on this page Small wonder you remain anonymous Adrian Ashfield,0
I would question the timing of the poll The governor had just talked about it public and there were all of these anti tax rallies I question if the poll is just a statistical anomaly or an actual desire to succeed Moreover the paragraph says this is not unusual for a state to have making it of questionable notability Something like this belongs on the Politics of Texas page not this one,0

I think that you are misunderstanding my point I brought up capitalism as an example in order to demostrate the shortcomings of the approach taken in the writing of the pargraph I m calling into question It is POV and original research to attribute every occurrence in a Communist regime to Communism independent of other historical factors just as it is POV and original research to attribute every occurrence in a society where private ownership of capital generates the bulk of economic output to capitalism However you may be able to incorporate these observations about history of Communist regimes if you 1 do a better job presenting contending POVs and contextualizing the history and 2 citing authoritative research not just recording these occurrences under Communism but also stating inferences about the relationship between these occurrences and Communism,0

This is the accurate place to discuss the failure of the GRG It is the place to talk about the improvements needed here One improvement is the failure of the GRG to have an oldest living man as a back up to the previous record holder If they are going to be a reliable source why would you drop the ball and not have at least two males verified at all times That should be a minimum standard so when someone comes to Wikipedia they can know who the oldest living man is If the GRG wants to be considered the primary source of data they should act like they care who the oldest living man is If they cared we would all ready know They are concerned with females born before 6 9 1904 or before Does anyone really care who the next 112 year old female is Or is it more likely they want to know who the oldest man in the world is I believe the oldest man is the answer to the questions You notice user Fisk a obvious GRG person will not answer the question why are they are concerned with women age 112 and could care less about men He then claims it gender Bias to know who the oldest man is and his back up and having both verified in case the record holder dies If the GRG is a primary source act like one Preceding unsigned comment added by,0

There are 2 sources for a higher figure estimation one numbers 350 500 000 people of Serbian origin in Chichago and illinios area alone the other source is for whole Serbian ancestral population in the Usa the estimates go between 700 000 and 1 million Serbs and Montenegrins in Usa sinc eMontenegrins are a much smaller group but still i didnt want to put the largest estimate from that source So i chose a middle number a middle number between 700k and 1 mil is 850 000 Go through dozens of other sources on internet you will find these estimations even higher stating always around up to 1 million or more than 1 million people of serbian origin in usa including a fact that a vast majority of people who declare as Yugoslavs are Serbs by origin and alot of those who assimilated simply everything that is written in that source the numbers of estimations can add up There are several other ethnic group articles like English people like Greeks or Bosniaks or Bulgarians or several other articles that use higher estimations for certain countries like USA So why wouldnt Serbs article use a higher estimation The sources are from U S Embassy and Serbian consule in Chichago I think its a good edit and if these sources are POV then all sources all over the internet dozens of them serbian or american or someone elses that estimate a ca 1mil number are Pov by you,0
I believe sanctions would be required to deal with EEng s COI and POV issues specifically a topic ban I ve since returned the Macmillan book and other materials it d take me probably a month to get those back So its not going to be fixed in the short term if a topic ban is issued Though yes your analysis was great and hopefully helpful for the future efforts to tackle this page s issues,0

The Chinese government is using this incident for propagandistic purposes therefore it s propaganda Use of that term does not mean that the incident was staged or that they discovered it before fenqing like you did It doesn t mean it s a conspiracy It means they are consciously using the event to push opinion in China a certain way On a related note I am tired of giving free English lessons to Wikipedia editors who don t know how to use a dictionary If your English isn t good enough to understand the difference between a conspiracy and propaganda then you should be editing in your native language not on English Wikipedia,0

You have no right to claim that my suggestions for improving the quality of this article is influenced by what you perceive to be my religious tradition that is very insulting Furthermore you seem biased in your posts as shown by if Hakim had shown more respect for my religion instead of ordering the destruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in 1009 A D Someone in such a biased position as you is not even remotely qualified to claim authority over a subject such as this I am in contact with professors who are experts in the fields of Near Eastern Middle Eastern and Islamic studies My grandfather for example being one of those aforementioned professors received his PhD in Islamic Near Eastern studies from the University of Michigan with a specialization in Ismaili thought and since you are so quick to accuse others of biases which I suspect is a projection of your own flaws I want to make it clear that neither he nor I are Muslims I do not need to qualify myself to someone such as yourself seeing as I am more of an authority on the subject anyways And since u seem to be so interested in this subject I have been told that a lot of information concerning Al Hakim has been found in the Genizah documents The information present there has contradicted a lot of the so called facts about Al Hakim that you mentioned Since history is not all fact and contains a lot of speculation and conjecture I suggest you choose what to believe carefully and avoid forming hasty biased opinions based on shady testimonia The journal of near eastern studies as well as the encyclopedia of islam even though reputable in their own right rely on whatever information is available With hardly any information available on certain subjects it is not wise to blindly accept certain questionable information even though it may suit your own personal and sometimes biased purposes I m planning an edit of this article to make it more scholarly and less biased I m sure you wont mind,0

You also said If something looks promising other researchers and companies quickly test similar or closely related substances You seem to have this bizarre fantasy that if something looks promising other companies will band together to pay off hundreds of doctors and scientists to suppress or persuade everyone to ignore it or that thousands of doctors and scientists will not be able to recognize that it has potential value But note that thousands of doctors and scientists ARE able to recgonize the value of glyconutrients and this number grows daily see glycoscience org for peer reviewed studies and references for names of scientists and doctors in spite of the pharmaceutically influenced social paradigm impacted by lobbing advertising and held also status quo that slows all progress such as the discovery of connection between citrus fruit and scurvey Note that you lack citing sources all throughout your remarks as I dothat allows us to have a discussion,0

Do you add or change emphasis of the original source for a neutral article I think Pope Benedict XVI expresses a fairly balanced point of view Problems yes A vitality of faith yes Insurmountable no Hope is a virtue Love requires patience It takes time to work things out especially dealing with an imperfect rabble of people such that Christians are When Moses went to Mount Sinai he was absent for over a month before the 10 commandments were set in stone I certainly can wait a while before Pope Benedict XVI sets things in stone If it s a situation that has become grave I m sure we ll hear from Pope Benedict XVI at WYD in Sydney with the Holy Spirit being the theme for the whole thing Things to consider for further resources RCIA and the catechumenate throughout the history and Teaching of the church the origin history and processes of valid catholic rites etc This is a problem that s too big for me but no one is more suited than the blessed popes we ve had in current and recent history newbie,0

I think the parsimoneous thing is simply to delete Saducees and Pharisees It is misleading to say religious authorities because neither Jews nor Romans thought of them as specifically religious authorities they certainly were religious by modern lights but to use our own categories to describe institutions from 2000 years ago is anachronistic We can leave it at Jewish authorities since all the linked articles go into the details Romano Jewish authorities sounds awful although of course Paul s larger point is correct that the political authorities were Roman supported But Vermes Sanders Fredricksen agree that he debated with other kinds of authorities including probably Pharisees I still think just plain Jewish authorities is enough for a paragraph in the introduction Linked articles can go into the heterogeneous nature of jewish authority at that time as well as its relationship to the Romans indeed the linked articles do just this It is not that I disagree with CTSWyneken about what the historians say I just think in an introductory section we should avoid this much detail,0

There is a claim made on this page that the King James Bible is under perpetual copyright protection in the UK Where does this claim come from There is only one published work I know of that has extraordinary provisions inserted into legislation and that is Peter Pan According to the Act the following applies to that work 1 1 In this Schedule the Hospital means The Hospital for Sick Children Great Ormond Street London the trustees means the special trustees appointed for the Hospital under the 1977 c 49 National Health Service Act 1977 and the work means the play Peter Pan by Sir James Matthew Barrie 2 Expressions used in this Schedule which are defined for the purposes of Part I of this Act copyright have the same meaning as in that Part Entitlement to royalty 2 1 The trustees are entitled subject to the following provisions of this Schedule to a royalty in respect of any public performance commercial publication broadcasting or inclusion in a cable programme service of the whole or any substantial part of the work or an adaptation of it 2 Where the trustees are or would be entitled to a royalty another form of remuneration may be agreed Crown copyright of published works last 50 YEARS FROM DATE OF PUBLICATION So applying normal standards to the KJ Bible its copyright would have expired long ago Never mind the fact that it was published about 100 years before copyright even existed as a legal entity and concept So until and unless someone can come up with a quotation from a legal text or statute I would regard the claim that perpetual copyright exists as completely bogus to say the least,0

Restoring valid material is what Giovanni calls putting in one sided observations about a time outside the early Christian period claiming without evidence that the Edict of Milan a proclamation that permanently established religious toleration for Christianity within the Roman Empire It was the outcome of a political agreement concluded in Milan between the Roman emperors Constantine I and Licinius in February 313 The proclamation made for the East by Licinius in June 313 granted all persons freedom to worship whatever deity they pleased assured Christians of legal rights including the right to organize churches and directed the prompt return to Christians of confiscated property Previous edicts of toleration had been as short lived as the regimes that sanctioned them but this time the edict effectively established religious toleration 1998 Encyclopaedia Britannica gave the Church a privileged position etc etc In early June I left the unbalanced text in the article for as long as there was hope that someone would try seriously to defend it only afterwards did I return it to a more neutral and truthful text This time the latter text has been in possession for a couple of weeks and should not be banished without previous discussion Shall we start with the question of the post 325 material,0

I see Kinsella Pete Peters says on his blog that I smeared his mother here Actually all I did was ask if she was an ethicist too This is the kind of guy we re dealing with Here s what I posted Actually after doing the morning dishes I ve had an utter and complete reversal of views I had though Warren s father was just some old sawbones everyone s doctor is renowned to his patients That s the secret of medicine The fact the guy was a serious scholar of ethics needs to be in there In an article about the self styled Prince of Darkness and the author of Kicking Ass In Canadian Politics the fact his father was an ethicist has all kinds of Freudian implications Anyone know anything about his mom He never mentions her Maybe she was an ethicist too Arthur Ellis,0

Religious Jews from any of the main Jewish denominations reach out to ethnic Jews and ask them to rediscover Judaism In the case of some Hasidic denominations eg Chabad Lubavitch this outreach extends to active proselytizing Proselytizing You can t proselytize to someone who is already the same religion as you Observant Jews generally discourage conversion anyway Outreach gives people the chance to act Jewish not to convert to Orthodox Judaism Conversion to Orthodox Judaism doesn t exist if you re already Jewish This is a term that shows clear prejudice against outreach activity by groups such as Aish HaTorah and Chabad The article is supposed to be unbiased neutral and objective That sentence needs to be removed Preceding unsigned comment added by,0

I concur with JCO312 nearly every capital eligible case either terminates in a sentence of death or life without parole But it also depends on the flexibility of the state s laws For example in California for many serious felonies like the intentional wrecking of a train the only sentencing choice available once the charge has been presented and proved is between LWOP and death Of course there are lesser felonies which allow for more flexibility but our prosecutors as in most U S jurisdictions like to bring the maximum charge that the facts will arguably support,0
It was my impression that consensus meant 100 vaguely stated since the official policy states that all of the voters agree to go with the move even if they disagree I myself don t get this part It was also under my impression that only when the voters participate in the discussion they actually experience the process of shaping your choice All these move are disappointing me a lot They don t show any logical side to you humans This is like a mass pushing their way in You guys never participated in the discussion I mean I m ok with the move in and of itself but how it was moved seems to me to be completely ridiculous I m not working on this article right now but when I become an admin and get myself a place I ll make sure to move it back or create another article of the same niche,0

So your criticism of the other recommendations in short is that they are not identical to Finkel s Osman s Dream Yes it s true Finkel s book is the only modern single volume history of the empire written by an academic When we have such a well received book which is both factually accurate and highly readable for a general audience what is the merit to recommending by its side the older and outdated histories it has come to replace Why must a history book encompass the entire chronological and geographical span of the empire s history in order to fit into your conception of what the popular reader wants Is it not possible for the general reader to be interested only in the empire s recent history or only in its impact on the Arab Middle East in light of recent events Douglas Howard discusses the issue of Ottoman history for a popular audience in his 2004 review Three Recent Ottoman Histories and further recommends Daniel Goffman s The Ottoman Empire and Early Modern Europe 2002 saying it s likely to be of great interest to general readers It is however not a survey of the entire history of the empire from start to finish and from Hungary to Yemen Would that disqualify it from being recommended here,0

No ritual is cited in the article If any ritual were to be cited this would be wrong because If it is current it is Copyright If it is so old as to be not in Copyright then the ritual is no longer done in that way Ritual is usually only exposed by Anti Masonic types to reveal secrets Because Freemasonry is Constitutional and not a religion only the last and current issue of any ritual is relevant to any discussion beyond antiquarian interest A publicly available and published ritual is not always the one used by any particular Private Lodge since a wide latitude is given in any Grand Lodge or Orient over performing such ritual To sum up it is futile to debate secrets here in the public domain as no secrets will be given up here and no naughty secrets are found in any publicly found sources There are no naughty secrets to be found The point about one Mason recognising another by passing secrets is just silly these days even if it ever applied since after an initial introduction a detailed protocol of conformation is gone through before a stranger can get into an active Lodge etc I would say that anyone showing undue interest in the craft beyond what is already here in the article should go and get a life validated in some more fruitful way,0

Victoriaearle As an editor since 2008 with 24 533 edits and creator of several articles which I am not even going to try to count I do not understand what you are saying here This article is about the ship and the historic voyage As to one of them my answer is Not everyone reads every article on a subject If you wish to read more about the Mayflower Compact please look at the article with that name It is linked in blue for that exact purpose The Mayflower Compact is mentioned briefly because it was signed on the ship toward the end of the voyage Also why would you want to de link Iconic The purpose of linking is for persons who may not understand what a word means I would suggest that you read Wikipedia Manual of Style Linking The rest of your objections I will look at one to one but the article is referenced appropriately and the wp Scope is appropriate If you understand the American Constitution you will understand the statement about the Mayflower Compact The Vikings remark really I don t know what to say about that Bradford is the author of the account of the voyage and I does not confirm any facts about the comparison of the Mayflower Compact to the United States Consitution I see that Bowman is already in place to reference that statement,0

Hi all I m a brand new user just coming to grips with everything so please bear with me I found the section entitled Philosophical Doctrines to be somewhat unsatisfactory As far as I can tell the sections 2 5 2 8 Pragmatism through to The analytic tradition don t actually feature a clarification definition of what the doctrine is actually about I read right through the existentialism section and found a detailed description of which thinkers founded developed or influenced Existentialism but no where did I find a concise sentence explaining exactly what existentialism is Perhaps each of these sections should begin with a concise definition of the subject matter of the doctrine followed by relevant material I know you guys have been working on shortening the article so perhaps each heading should simply contain an explanation of subject matter and relevant figures and leave the detailed subject history for the separate article sub page PS OK so the Pragmatism section does feature a concise definition but it s not the first line of the section as it is on the sections above 2 1 2 4 Maybe it should be shifted up a bit,0

I don t understand why you might imagine that I condone serial plagiarism wiki stalking or harassment as I can assure that I most certainly do not And I see nobody shutting their eyes to anything A truth that may have escaped you though is that plagiarism is mistakenly in my view allowed on wikipedia so long as there s some kind of acknowledgement somewhere Indeed I had an argument about plagiarism fairly recently during a GA review IIRC where I refused to accept it But you have to look at where each article is now not its genesis,0

appears to be relying solely on one introducary textbook Philosophy of Mind A Contemporary Introduction by John Heil Alas he doesn t seem to have paid attention to what his book is telling him For example the book says Minds are related to brains in something like the way computer programs are related to the hardware in which they are implemented Minds are not identifiable with or reducible to brains for just the reasons that programs or computational operations are not identifiable with or reducible to components of the hardware on which they run but thinks it says the mind and mental states are best understood not as one or more objects but as functional systems that operate on the brain in much the same way that computer programs operate on computer hardware This misses the entire point of the author s analogy which is that minds brains and programs hardware share one attribute nonredusability The bit about best understood as is not in the source Computer programs do not operate on hardware in much the same way that minds operate on the brain The two are completely different,0
My agenda was to remove the tendentious pro NAMBLA editoralising from the article Beyond that I don t intend being drawn into polemical arguments with anonymous editors or indeed with anyone I agree with you that the strict definition of paedophile is a person attracted to pre pubescent children and that not all NAMBLA people met this definition since some were interested in having sex with adolescents rather than children I think the standard term for this is ephebophile so I will change the opening sentence accordingly I removed the detailed account of the Boston trials because it was hopelessly polemical and not really to the point I have no detailed knowledge of the cases in the criminal allegations section so I left it alone If you know this section to be inaccurate you are free to edit or delete it Adam Carr is my real name by the way what s yours,0

I ve just added bands Armored Saint and Danzig that Mr Troll wanted to add because they are relevant to this article as far as I know Any objection As for Fastway originally I was quite disposed to include them but well when thinking of it now i think Fastways is much more hard rock than heavy metal They re quite close to Led zep sound Should we inlcude it or not Actually it depends what we call traditional heavy metal here But well here s the problem There often two meaning to heavy metal as some encyclopedias explain Heavy metal was originally a synonym to hard rock and ithis meaning is still often used in USA if you need the sources I can provide them In this sense then hard rock bands like Led zep can be called Heavy metal However the term heavy metal also has shifted with time And in Europe it may be used as opposed to hard rock As a matter of fact traditional heavy metal is also used to refer to bands who droped blues roots and got a more radical sound than Hard rock In this sense only bands following Black Sabbath or Judas Priest can be called Heavy metal That s the way Sharpe young in his definitive metal guide uses the term for example I m writting quikely here if you need the sources just ask This difference of use of the term is frequently a source of confusion in debate over here in wikipedia So I think we should take in account this potential source of confusion and decide which one of the sense we use Personnaly I sure propose to mention both definitions I woulmd favour Sharpe Young s approch over traditional use Lester Bangs Because using the term Heavy metal as a synonymous to Hard rock here would lead to useless doubloon with the Hard rock article If we use this second meaning as a main focus then Fastways or bands like Led zep or AC DC should not be included in the article,0

Your suggestion is impractical Opinion polling for the Republican Party United States presidential primaries 2008 is too long already as it is improper not all polls are land line phone based Zogby International for instance use a large panel of volunteers polled via Internet surveys with results weighed in accordance with the relevant population Also most people when told opinion polling for presidential primaries think about wiki links not blatantly unscientific polls such as straw polls or web polls there is a reason they re called straw polls Anyway I have edited the article s introduction in order to clarify what type of polls are listed in the article and added links to other relevant polling articles I hope this settles things or at least helps in some way,0

The version on behalf of which Radiopathy has argued is clearly much preferable on the grounds of accuracy It is debatable whether or not the song was performed by The Beatles On the other hand it is indisputable that John Lennon wrote the entirety of the original song and the vast majority of the released version it is also indisputable that the officially distributed version was released under the name The Beatles For even greater precision without getting too long winded perhaps the version proposed by Radiopathy Free as a Bird is a song written by John Lennon and later released as a record under the name The Beatles Could be modified thus Free as a Bird is a song originally composed by John Lennon and later released as a record under the name The Beatles Again the question of whether it is proper to say this song was performed by The Beatles is a highly contentious one and the opening of the article should avoid taking sides on it The proposed alternative is both more informative and much less open to dispute,0

Duck I am persuaded that the introduction needs to be shortened and therefore am in favor of simple accounts of only the most essential points I think you have similar sentiments no I think the above is good but perhaps the following improves on it somewhat This diagnosis was the center of a major dispute between her parents Robert and Mary Schindler and her husband Michael Schiavo her legal guardian by court appointment and led to numerous court cases over the course of several years In her last years Schiavo was examined by at least 8 neurologists all but one of whom concluded that she was in a PVS An evidentiary hearing held by a Florida court to determine the most credible assessment of her state of consciousness found that the evidence overwhelmingly supports the view that Terry Schiavo was in a persistent vegetative state This finding was subsequently upheld on every appeal both in state and federal courts This is about 30 words shorter and I think it avoids confusion by leaving out the doctor mathematics which can be detailed in the relevant section of the body of the article Once again I would note that at the moment there is little in the way of a reliable public record testifying to the status of Harrison and Desousa in the Schiavo case your edit may be successfully impeached by the mob before Cranford s paper is formally published July 3 2005 02 18 UTC,0

What s required is an effort to work toward consensus before you invoke consensus to block changes Name calling and refusal to address the basic points shows antipathy toward consensus Wikipedia should be neutral which doesn t happen when refs are one sided Refs have to do more than support what is said they have to be reliable and factual Opinion pieces published by the US military are neither At the very least Wikipedia should report opionated refs as expert opinion not fact But the fact is the refs don t support what is said Why don t you QUOTE the part of the refs you think support this article as a starting point for working toward consensus,0

Thomas s argument involves a examination of Hess that he Thomas personally performed in Spandau Hess had been shot some years earlier but Thomas found no evidence i e scarring on the man he examined in Spandau When Thomas questioned Hess about the wound Hess refused to answer and never spoke to Thomas again Thomas s examination of x rays taken of Hess in Spandau also showed no evidence that he had sustained a gunshot to the chest Scars corresponding to wounds in the left arm and the head that Hess is known to have sustained were also missing leading Thomas to the conclusion that the man in Spandau was indeed someone other than R Hess,0

To dispel any doubt there is an excellent article here about the relation between medieval philosophy and rationalism showing how Scholastic philosophers were essentially Christian rationalists The Rationalism of Scholasticism consists in the conviction that reason is to be used in the elucidation of spiritual truth and in defence of the dogmas of Faith It is opposed to mysticism which distrusted reason and placed emphasis on intuition and contemplation In this milder meaning of the term all the Scholastics were convinced Rationalists the only difference being that some like Abelard and Roscelin were too ardent in their advocacy of the use of reason and went so far as to maintain that reason can prove even the supernatural mysteries of Faith while others like St Thomas moderated the claims of reason set limits to its power of proving spiritual truth and maintained that the mysteries of faith could not be discovered and cannot be proved by unaided reason,0

Let s refrain from personal attacks The text of the article as you have edited it before I revert your latest edit reads The permit was issued Monday March 31 but work actually began the day before Palm Sunday This makes the article inaccurate It has nothing to do with the reference You can look at your version and compare it to the original if you don t believe that If you have some problem with the link formatting you can change that without modifying the text of the article,0
I am not even neccesarily against it but when you go off and nominate images used on this election controversy page for deletion without mentioning it here on the talk page and even worse you requested a speedy delete when you are definitely aware there are numerous people that disagree with you tells me you may not understand or respect the wikipedia guidelines on controversy resolution Here is your request Even if the images are themselves unverifiable please give us time to find other sources for that data,0
Oppose this and polls skepticism is always good It s not the same as accusations of fraud,0
I m not just talking about referencing I m talking about depth of coverage Fraser was PM for twice as long as Whitlam but his article is seriously inferior and he has had a solid biography Ayres we could canibalise The difference is systemic bias everyone hates Fraser even Liberals these days so no one bothers with his article By the way does anyone know what happened to Cathy Whitlam The three sons are easily googleable but she has presumably married and disappeared from view,0
Haha what all the modern reliable sources say is the natives in VA mostly got their firearms between the years 1656 and 1676 when the House of Burgesses apparently tolerated a group of kidnappers from the great lakes known as the Westo in exchange for English muskets The real problem here is too many reliable sources from professionals talking about this in detail to quote but just a couple I found that seem good and recent Cynthia A Kierner Sandra Gioia Treadway 2015 Virginia Women Their Lives and Times Volume 1 Page 40 Allan Gallay 2009 Indian Slavery in Colonial America p 217 and 2002 The Indian Slave Trade The Rise of the English Empire in the American South p 41 Eric E Bowne 2005 The Westo Indians Slave Traders of the Early Colonial South Regards,0

Okay Those points convinced me to go a different direction,0
I don t think it s mentions of the categories I was referring to actual articles If that site is using some variation of MediaWiki then Wikisposure com anyname is an article and Wikisposure com Category whatever would be a category My point is this If there is a reference to the wikisposure article on a person that is alleged to be a pedophile or a sex offender or something like that we CANNOT include it in the article as it would be a blatant BLP violation not to mention irrelevant to the point of this article That s why I m saying anything that needs to be referenced to any part of Wikisposure MUST be referenced to a section that is NOT about a living person or we can t use it at all Son of the Defender,0
You have to assess the claims of the source that you present as verifiablity especially when it comes from ONLY one source namely 1UP com I saw the trailer myself at the show and I drew a different conclusion than 1UP com yet I am not cited in the article as they are The trailer DOES NOT I cannot overemphasize this it DOES NOT ANYWHERE OR IN ANYWAY SHAPE OR FORM declare or state that FFXIII is a PS3 exclusive title IT SIMPLY DOESN T There is no need for interpretation here neither the trailer nor the Square Enix representatives at the event stated the game was a PS3 exclusive When the company itself DOES NOT say this there is no reason to turn to a second hand source Josh,0
This article has unfortunately been allowed to languish for some time what s good about it hasn t been particularly well organized or in some cases verified and a clearly contentious section called Controversy accounts for nearly half the text I d like to change that and I ve prepared an alternate version of this entry available in my user space here I happen to work with Time Inc so because of my potential conflict I will avoid moving my draft over for now I intend for this comment to serve as a request for an uninvolved editor to consider replacing the current article with my draft or something similar to it Most of what I have changed is not very controversial I ve located citations to verify accurate material in this entry and re organized the article structure to better reflect the shape of his public career More sensitive of course are the topics covered in the existing Controversy section Some of that could be an issue under the Biographies of living persons policy and I d be interested in another editor s opinion about that material but I ll punt on that for the moment The one topic for which I will offer a suggestion relates to the fourth and fifth paragraphs Specifically that topic is the early 2008 Time cover in which the border was changed to green and the famous Iwo Jima photograph was adapted for the issue s environmental theme You ll find it in the Managing editor of Time magazine section in my proposed draft I d very much appreciate anyone who takes the time to read through my draft and consider these changes If you have any questions or comments I m open to discussing any of them Here s hoping we can find consensus to bring this article closer in line with Wikipedia s guidelines Cheers,0

Hi there I wonder if I could grab your expertise I ve been working on wiki link which you might know started its seventh series yesterday One of the main characters Jonny has been written out but his section in wiki link refers to events going way back to the beginning Another user wants to move his section into a new Former characters section and I am resisting on the basis that there are few characters in the series he is central to it and it makes no sense to me to have a separate section considering that this will probably be the last series anyway I see wiki link characters get moved into a complete new article but Two Pints is a lot smaller in scope Having failed to find any guidelines for this would you mind letting me have your opinion Thanks,0
I have just reverted Raggz s recent edits please do not make these changes without discussing first discuss involves more than one person i e not just you I must reiterate a previous user s comments that it would be recommendable for you to make gradual changes discussing them first on the talk page,0
Breach is a point of disagreement If there is mediation that issue will be included If you read all of the previous comments you will find disagreement about the breach issue I m not arguing whether it is or isn t in breach I m simply pointing out the disagreement,0
You have completely change the table format in this edit which confuses me and will confuse even more anyone else who now reads the above conversation For clarity the old example looked like this The new version is better It still needs a link to the article in the first column and we will still need a citation to a reliable source not classfever com at least in situations where the school has no article on Wikipedia,0
What exactly is your complaint If the FFRF really did publish the only freethought newspaper and radio program then these are facts that bear no relevance on whether there are similar freethought organizations or not The point is that there may be other organizations but do they publish newspapers and broadcast radio programs,0
When I removed the statement put it back claiming that I would need to prove that the statement is false suggesting that Until anyone does this this fact remains undisputed Which is of course rediculous I m removing the comment again on the ground that I disagree with the statement and I m not alone I would like to see proof a reference of the suggestion that CS makes the aforementioned assumption at all As far as I know CS doesn t asume Creation can be observed Duh I disagree with refering to Creation without explaining what is mens by the word I can observe creation I m creating tension right now,0
So far there s the YES side and the NO side As an encyclopedia it would be not only nice but nessesary to present both sides of opinions so to stay neutral For example the article should state the cause of the original conflict in much MUCH more details The point of view perspective and intentions of the nations who are supporting against its independence should also be stated As it is an important aspect of the entire conflict international recognition is needed for a state to become actually independent for example Quebec and Taiwan is not independent but Singapore is,0
Interesting Bruce since the house seems to be on flat land as if on the plains of the Cauto not the hills of Trinidad the road appears straight smooth and wide not cobble stone hilly and curved and with high sidewalks as one would expect in Trinidad Besides that same source erroneously identified that truck as participating in the assault on Moncada in Santiago instead of the Presidential Palace in Havana Again I wonder if somebody is feeding false information Could you find out more BTW a painted house is a rarity in Cuba El Jigue 5 21 06,0

It is wacko fringe opinionj and has no place in a wiki article The author claims that under a gold standard economic growth would cease if gold mining stopped There are 3 things that contribute to economic growth Ideas for making old products better or at lower cost assembly line thinking up new products some of which can make older products cheaper or faster computers and automated assembly lines and more hands to do the work For the authors opinion not to wacko fringe somehow a stop in gold mining would make people cease thinking of better ways to make new products cease thinking of new products and somehow would make people stop having babies As it stands that opinion is about as popular as UFO s are based inside a hollow earth aka WACKO FRINGE,0

Looks like you were twarted in your threat at an attempt at official sanction and instead have attempted a last ditch effort to come across as conciliatory yet with your continued attacks on people are made out to be insincere Remind me but are you not the champion of the gasoline vesus airplane fuel speculation based reasoning that despite repeated notices of the proper word rather than your speculative word insisted that there was no evidence of such in the film basing it on the script that turned out to be a draft evidently early in the production process that did not reflect the language if the film in those portions that it contained as compared to the final released version and most importantly would have shown with a cursery look at the end that the film according to that script stoped with Katherine in the cave Wrong move in verifying your source to supoport your speculation This in addition to your own admission that at least for the scene that contained that dialogue in the film you could not recall and although a speculation would bring me to the conclusion that you very well may either have never seen the movie or have such a distorted rememberance of it that you are not one with which I am comfortable relying upon for any language in what may be the article plot version to be submitted for review suitability of wiki standards I would disagree with the intent of this new section about the discussion coming to a low point but that in what i have seen in the reversions by you that the points raised by the original post are valid There is much to be substantiated by the use of the film transcript that has perviously been let be without any reason to think differently That very well seems to be your nemisis Who in the world would hav thought it necesary to consult a film dialogue transcript to support their speculation just to be refuted by that assertion Your assertion of those three words have already been deemed a run on sentence and yet again you persist in what language that has been well established and what seems acceptable to all with the three word issue except for yourself Sad but true I am glad that it has been brough forth your language questioning someone about their language I hope you are not involved in the educatuional process in any country since it seems you have a deep prejudice toward those that do not meet your expectation That is an attiude to be absolutely absent from the educational process All I read when you respond is is I MY etc and total discount of what others suggest That the we and everyone expressed in the prompting of this section is the royal we which in reality is I or more specially characterized as you You have long established that Editing this page has with all your activities been solely reserved for the plot whereas others have contribued new portions have improved already existing portions and have conbtributed what seems to be all the recent links It would appear as such it is your intention to dominate the development of the plot The record will show this Your purported purpose of this section very well would have been best suited to an already existing section to which you seemed to attempt to discount by saying that person had to prove their points when in fact the whole purpose of this talk page is not to create new sections in order to avoid previously establshed section but to work through which already seems to be at odds with you because you lodged a dsipute over an expression which already the preliminary suggestion by the referee discounts your original expression as a run on sentence And as if that were not enough in the spirit of the wiki community you insist that the sequence by which you expressed it had to be maintained The ideas are there What is so important about your expression being the only acceptable language Sounds like a power play Speculation but true and accurate In fact I think you will long for the day that you never said those few but significant wordstrue and accurate What is the dialogue from Gosford Park That which you despise lives forever,0

I think this deserves mentioning in the article This speech from Dick Cheney is quite interesting He points out that although Obama released to the public the information about interrogating terrorist suspects Obama has not let the public know the information that was obtained through these interrogations Cheney claims that the interrogations prevented the violent death of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of innocent people and criticizes Obama for making the interrogation methods public while keeping the info about the terrorists plots that was stopped by the interrogations a secret,0
Err did you read the first sentence of the article by any chance Israel approved a construction plan Tuesday for hundreds of houses in a disputed neighborhood on Jerusalem s southern outskirts A I don t appreciate you making comments about my so called selection bias B I m not the one who put that source there Comment on the article please But while we re on the commenting on selection bias train as for the giant picture it sounds like you knew what you were looking for before you even loaded the source And for the record there is nothing linking Gilo to settlement in the source It discusses settlement construction but specifically does not reference Gilo in that context I wonder why,0

Dear you do not know that the article is disputed crankish poorly sourced fringe material The statements by Zakir Naik on the rights on non muslims were properly sourced material of much importance to the article to maintain a balanced viewpoint You have repeatedly and continously indulged in deletion of this material Your actions have constituted a blatant violation of WP BLP Read the 50 page long talk page and you will understand the reasons for the disputed status You are probably blind to this gross censorship since you yourself were the censor Until and unless a fully balanced viewpoint is presented ofcourse in compliance with WP BLP in the article the tag cannot be removed BTW there is absolutely no necessity for a 24 hour window as it is perfectly clear to any Non Islamic fundamentalist from the talk page that this article is totally disputed And if you ITAQALLAH still feel the material that you censored was crankish poorly sourced fringe material then please visit and please read the articles on Zakir Naik in and,0

Well I think you worry about nothing What should not be done is to use such a phrase in the voice of Wikipedia with merely a footnote referring to the source the BBC But that s not what s going on here The phrase is in quote marks and its provenance is given right in the text has been described by the BBC as an acute debt crisis that threatens the eurozone Provided the source is highly reputable which I assume nobody will deny that s just fine ASFAIC You see the distinction Uh what exactly is an official source Also the quote doesn t sound unduly emotive to me more like consensus among wiki link actually I ve been hearing and reading similar phrasing all day long from the fairly starchy media in my own part of Europe,0

I was citing the second book when I wrote the sentence in the brackets As for the Azerrad quote read bellow I do get your point but you can t get mine AJFA is thrash with progressive metal in it as the author said Are you aware that you basically claim that Justice is progressive metal album consisted of nine thrash metal tracks And by the way why did you reverted my edit on the single s page of the same name If you can find better source go ahead and add it But you should know that aren t professional reviews for that one because it s a promo single Till then the proper thing to do is the current source to remain,0
My apologies for the snide remark however we are all best served by addressing specific issues rather than blanket denunciations of sources As for standards of proof first off it is really not our place to attempt to establish that we need to be guided by usage which here I have followed However if we are to briefly digress and speculate about their feelings for each other I would suggest that you bring to mind all the uncontested actions of the two and then picture Selim as your own son and Lawrence as a neighbor and see where your reason guides you I might also suggest that if Dahoum had been a woman there would be scant opposition to the suggestion that the two had been in a love relationship Finally please bear in mind that no conclusions about any sexual aspect to their relationship have been drawn There is a huge gulf between love even erotic love as this seems to have been and sexuality per se Regarding your mention of unanimity none is implied nor is it needed or even possible I can t really speak to the other claims of the KC article I will however continue to look for sources for this article,0
And that information will be found here And someday a valid ref will be added to it Thats how Wiki works As before there is nothing controversial here This isn t information that is drastically lowering the dependability of Wikipedia it has none to start with There is no violation of wiki link here It s just gear All gear that is out there for everyone to see It can be deleted it is blatantly wrong But that would also take a citation It s unthreatening and perfectly fine the way it is and it can patiently stay that way until a cite comes along,0
Based on comments here I ve returned the article to the previous title there are too many objections to the move Future moves requests should follow WP RM,0

Gosh You still stonewall gravity versus newton and need to differentiate between historical use of a term and application of it Apples and Oranges Better answer the points raised before you start again personal attacks Radkau is rather critical about the prophets of sustainability which took a mining expert for the first green and tried to tell the narrative about Sustainability as savior of the world from that As pointed out todays use of sustainability started with Brandt Brundlandt based on german Nachhaltigkeit the implied glorification of a minor aspect of forestry is being critized by Radkau but still alive in the article,0

Do you want me to remove non puerto ricans from that page as well Really I ve been waiting for you to actually start talking instead of reverting every single edit to YOUR page It s not YOUR page If you were an editor that actually talked things out we wouldn t be in this situation YOU are the one that obviously likes edit wars If you just remove the non Mexican boxers from the list it would all be settled Instead you just revert without discussion Big man with the insults and the threats,0

If you guys want to rewrite and reorganize the article in any way go ahead I ll let you do what you want if that is your desire Of course this article was voted as Good Article so it sort of makes you guys accusations of this being poorly written as dubious I do not think the article needs changed but I have done all I wanted to on this article and right now I do not have much time nor desire to help in any reorganization of the article If others want to find the original longer article they can always find it Regarding the 1928 World Series Techmobowl if you had thorough knowledge the subject you would have instantly known it was a mistake and you would have corrected it I have not watched the article for over a month and I have not gone over the article in detail for some time to moniter how original information may have been corrupted by other users You guys seem to take my criticism of your writing skills as personal attacks and this is not the case I criticize your writing skills on this article your writing on other articles may be fine The biggest problem I have with you guys is you make many obvious proof reading mistakes hence I question your attention to the finer details of good writing and I wonder if you guys have really done any complete research on Ruth These basic mistakes make the article look unorganized and unfactual Also I do not believe one should not be obsessed with length quality is the only thing that matters No one ever agrees on the right length for articles anyway and I find preconceived ideas of what the right length is counter productive if one is cutting articles shorter for the mere sake of keeping them shorter Wikipedia articles especially the biographical ones are getting longer and longer and while longer articles do not automatically equal more quality more information that is well written at least in my opinion is always better The point about his team teammates family etc being included or deleted Ruth plays on a team and baseball not an individual sport His team merits a mention because success or lack of success of the team also effects Ruth Note that the mention of his team and or teammates was always a brief paragraph except the 1927 team I also like having more information about someones family but others may disagree Anyway I ll stop here You guys construct the article the way you want,0
Well the article i created then smart ass why should i let the template stay wen its a perfectly good article,1
You re adding incorrect information What am I meant to do I gave you references but you refuse to read them I guess I ll just have to explain the whole thing to you right here It will take time but I don t see that you ve given me any other choice I could list you on problem users and start reverting your material on sight but that s not very good PR And I m not sure which approach will take more of my time 07 50 26 Jul 2003 UTC,0

A truely critical approach does not start with an axe to grind An art critic may not like a particular artists work but they will analyse it on the basis of it s techniques and achievements admiting it s strengths and stating their preferences as a POV That is why I disagree with the use of the word critical and prefer criticize as all that I have read on antiscience so far has been scathing of science and it s achievements The scientific method has it s good and bad points a critical view would evaluate all of these,0
You re the confused one My punishment section says nothing about man in general it treats only the use of docking on man just as on animals but for other intentinally cruel reasons It is quite impossibe to push a POV even if there were one by a title which leaves it to the reader to fill in either Human or Inhuman Nor is bestiality non even mentioned a no sensical concept but a common word specifically constructed to brand some of the worst human behovior as at least as bad as what zoological beasts sometimes do that seems cruel to ignorant human observers,1

In my opinion blowing away a considerable amount of someone else s work for a trivial reason is not an appropriate use of automated aids to editing As an administrator I am disappointed in you because I think you are setting a very bad example for less experience contributors I urge you to abandon this practice of relying on edit summaries in my opinion responsible editors do not rely solely on edit summaries to explain complicated or controversial edits because they realize this is the number one trigger for edit wars,0
I would also like to give my opinion but I don t see why we should all transfer it to ReformedArsenal s discussion page when this concerns improving this article First Council of Nicaea First of all clearly Gabby s editing was not in any way vandalism and accusations of being a vandal should not be thrown out lightly Secondly the edit warring went way too far per WP BRD the discussion about the article content should open up here not just on the users discussion pages Now getting to the actual dispute anything from a primary or secondary source showing what was discussed or not discussed at First Nicaea about the Holy Spirit should be fair game for our consideration I know there is at least some mention of it there if you look for it Per synth yes we should avoid boldly connecting dots that have never been connected before but with all the wealth of material here it shouldn t be too hard to find a discussion of this somewhere,0

This page has been hacked by those deliberately wishing to disparage defame Mark Dice This is how the top of the page should read Mark Shouldice born December 21 1977 known professionally as Mark Dice 1 is an author and a conservative media analyst based in San Diego California Dice s YouTube channel over 960 000 subscribers as of March 21st 2017 3 This is how the page was changed to disparage Mark Dice by referring to him as conspiracy theorist Mark Shouldice born December 21 1977 known professionally as Mark Dice 1 is an American activist and author known for his conspiracy theories about Satanic cults and Illuminati control of the world Based in San Diego California Dice is also a popular YouTuber who has over 900 000 subscribers as of February 15 2017 3 Mark Dice has openly requested help to have his information changed back to what I displayed above He can be reached immediately via his Twitter Feed if you need confirmation for the requested edit change Otherwise litigation will ensue and attorney fees will quickly add up Sincerely S Rex,0

Indeed Belgium is predominantly Dutch speaking But until recently the Dutch language was suppressed by the authorities in Flanders and French was enforced upon the Flemish population and therefore also in the colonies The complete history of the Flemish struggle for emancipation hasn t been explained properly yet in the en wikipedia This subject has been barely touched in the articles Flanders and Flemish movement A good external link in English is Flemish Movement even if it doesn t go all the way back into the historical causes of the oppression of the Flemish language dating back to the 15th 16th century Burgundy rulers Hapsburg rulers first Spanish later Austrian French revolutionaries This is a very complex matter,0

I believe in your good faith trying to solve this dispute but I have to disagree with your proposal of even considering Catalan Sea as an option leaving it only to Balearic Sea and Mediterranean Sea Why Because Catalan Sea lacks of any single juridical authority law i e de jure that stipulates that official name as you so many times exige in order to accept a proposal Being this a matter of using an internationally accepted name in International treaties under the International Law known and used by every country in the world without misleadings the options are clear The Catalan Sea name has not been accepted by the international community nor appears in any International treaty please refer to above s explanation In only appears in some scholars or books but again it lacks of International jurisdiction and or approval The Balearic Sea does have the approval full description resolution in the Law of the Sea and is perfectly delimited by the IHO in order to appear in sea charts worldwide This said I find that Mediterranean Sea is far more universal and much more preferable choice Cheers,0
You are not compromising you are edit warring I reverted your change of scope you replaced it I invoked BRD and reset it one last time to the original and informed you of it You reverted it again This is edit warring It does not have to be 3RR but you have made other changes to this page and have removed my edits placing you at and past 3RR by various interpretations Furthermore this is the scope of the DR you are changing something under discussion during the dispute resolution That is edit warring in of itself,0

The lead needs to be discussed Right now it shows as this Cloud Atlas is a 2012 German science fiction and drama film written and directed by Lana and Andy Wachowski and Tom Tykwer As stated above in this talkpage there is many countries involved in this production so putting one country in the lead is useless Also at one time this film was described as an epic adventure drama film I think that better suits it While there are science fiction elements to it the whole film can t be described as sci fi,0

Iraq did not exist in antiquity and using its modern boundaries as measures of extent when the ancient language was used beyond its borders is not really helpful There is no such thing as Ancient Iraq it was Mesopotamia or part of the Near East Iraq came into being in the modern era Assyria and Babylonia extended outside the boundaries of modern Iraq as did the Akkadian Empire so equating these regions with the boundaries of the modern country is not accurate The most common usage among historians etc for this region is Near East or Mesopotamia the latter term is less Eurocentric if that is a concern,0

Thanks and apologies I m not really familiar with either Septuagint or Vulgate But Lewis Short gives a circle circular course round ring for gyrus That may perhaps explain why Isidore in his etymologies compares orbis to orbiculus which means a small wheel As to why flat earthism reappeared when it did I don t think there is any agreed reason but I think the common assumption is that it had to do with the advance of science in the 19th century affecting common people for the first time and particularly with the dispute over origins and creation People were digging their heels in over all sorts of issues and the shape of the earth was a good rallying point for some that anyone could understand Garwood s book is the first to give any extended coverage to the idea and if you re in UK you can get it via Amazon very cheaply at the moment Not so good in the U S,0
I have a feeling the article was written in Japanese and translated back which is why it is in bad shape An example of what I mean would be Why is it that the article mentions manga television and computer games specifically Why wouldn t it be video games board games games in general or any type of media or form of entertainment And instead of stating that these 3 are most common medias the article simply states it as a fact it leaves no room for other forms of media The article is riddled with tons of errors like this,0

In a message posted to Keith Tyler s User Talk page Dreadlocke flatters Keith for his efforts to make the Natasha Demkina article neutral and then shows just what his idea of neutrality is He recommends linking the article to what he calls a fairly neutral web page Hi Keith an external control article that looks fairly neutral is from the Discovery Channel Fairly neutral See for yourself The Discovery Channel article begins Natasha Demkina has an extraordinary gift that means she can quite literally see right through people Her story sounds like it has come straight from the pages of a science fiction comic book but doctors have yet to disprove her amazing abilities Natasha is able to look into people s bodies and correctly diagnose their medical problems without any help from ultra sound or x ray equipment Neutral The Discovery Channel program is primarily about a scientific test of Natasha s claims that found no evidence of such powers Yet this article states that Natasha can quite literally see right through people s bodies and correctly diagnose their medical problems It makes absolutely NO mention that she was tested by researchers or that they concluded she is doing nothing more than using a cold reading technique commonly used by astrologers palm readers and other fortune telling charlatans Dreadlocke insists that he s only interested in establishing a neutral point of view in the Natasha Demkina article Yet he calls the Discovery Channel article fairly neutral Nothing that he s ever posted here shows his own lack of neutrality as much as that statement The Discovery Channel article claims that Natasha has supernatural powers that she is using to help people find out what is making them sick without any mention that scientific researchers tested her and found only evidence of deception He calls this a fairly neutral point of view It s clear why he is so unhappy with the Natasha Demkina article And it should be clear that he won t be happy until it is as neutral as the Discovery Channel article which claims that Natasha Demkina is helping people with her amazing paranormal powers while doctors are mystified Apparently in Dreadlocke s lexicon NPOV means agrees with him,0

Dan56 you re full of it Here s your quote on the Nicki Minaj talk page for Roman Reloaded where you cite Meta Critic as the end all By a show of hands or comments does this revision to the article s critical reception section smack of POV content removal WP VNT editorializing WP WORDS and undue weight to minority viewpoints WP UNDUE Oh and being neutral in form considering most of the reviews that the album received were mixed as verified by Metacritic and The Independent both of which are cited in the article yet the editor seems to overlook that using metacritic is lazy along with a few other reliable third party sources GoogleNews index of sources The Huffington Post Dan56 talk The Aaliyah album was rated 76 That s a fact Reverse me again and I ll bring your words from the other page to the forum Listen I appreciate what you re saying But it s also abundantly clear that you respect old school artists so do I But when I viewed the discourse you showed a lot of bias on that Nicki Minaj album Be reasonable You can t as verified by metacritic on one and then it s not the end all on another artist Let up on one or the other You need to be consistent i think you re probably a great editor but that kind of thing will sink you It s way too obvious you are leaning to the old schoolers Which I can t blame you for I agree But seriously when I read all your comments your definitely in the old school camp and clearly shaping it shall we say I ll change it to highly positive But if you get in those pissing matches trying to prove the new artists like Nikki whatever are not as cool I m gonna call attention to your contracdictions Wikipedia has to be consistent and you are not the king ok I ll change it back if you feel that strongly Undid my changes wanted to show good faith REchecked all the reviews They are actuall a bit more negative Have to use Metacritic as it stands,0

Micah 5 2 which Christians in general revere as a prophecy of the incarnation of Christ says that His goings forth have been from of old from everlasting KJV John 1 1 posits that In the beginning was the Word and goes on to explain in terms apparently accepted by Christians that the Word was made manifest in Christ In John 8 8 Christ claims that Before Abraham was I am The Christ of the canon is not characterized as having a beginning or an end but as being Alpha and Omega He IS the beginning and the end Rev 1 8 all things having been made by him John 1 3 But surely everyone without violation of theological conscience can agree that the Christian Era or if you prefer Common Era did indeed have a beginning Unless you believe that Christ is a created being thus having a beginning so that something could possibly be Before Him kindly consider shucking the concept Before Christ and its abbreviation BC both of which are unscriptural Hold fast to the wondrous doctrinal orthodoxy restored in BCE,0

The article needs shortening its current length is the result of wiki writers self indulgently showing off what they know like peacocks I say we should aim to take it right down to 25 of its current length As a guide check out these other articles Just as popular as Red Dwarf if not more so Links to full articles on each of the films etc but does not expand upon them in the main article itself Manages to list the differences between book and television adaptations and yet remains minimal in length short and sweet article contains all that is necessary and nothing more Not saying we should get this short but it s a brevity to aim for Far more episodes produced but resists the urge to indulge in providing every last detail about each one Could we start by removing completely the following sections from the Red Dwarf article I know you like them but it s like tidying a room chuck out the stuff you don t really need Or at least stick the information in a stub article 4 Themes 5 Hallmarks 6 Reception and achievements 6 1 Mixed reactions 6 2 Achievements 7 3 Magazine 7 6 Roleplaying game 7 7 Red Dwarf Night I think this will achieve a lot From here we d be able to cut back the remaining sections to something more manageable Let me know what you think,0

Str1977 Just to sum up the position of nearly everyone in this world once again If we would consider everyone that had lived during their lifetime within the borders of the Holy Roman Empire as German we would get a hell of a lot people in the list of Germans who are not regarded German by anyone including all Austrians until 1806 I mean really all of them without exceptions all Swiss who were born within the borders when parts of Switzerland belonged to the Holy Roman Empire Italy for its time under the Holy Roman Empiie France etc etc In the same line of thinking we would need to have all Austrians living between 1938 and 1945 to be considered German and be listed as Germans what they are obviously not or do you want to start to claim Schr dinger or Pauli or Sch nberg Germans The following points should be regarded in the case of Mozart 1 Where was he born where did he live and what country is the legal succesor to this territory Mozart was born in Salzburg and predominatly lived in Vienna Salzburg seized to exist as an independent nation at the beginning of the 19th century its direct legal successor was Austria and not Germany As of now Salzburg is not part of Germany but Austria 2 Does the fact that a country was member of the Holy Roman Empire make all its citizens Germans This is the ultimate question isn t it And the answer is clearly no There is a big number of examples just two additional ones to those I gave before Wilhelm Tell regardless of him being just a legend or a real person Metternich born 1773 listet as an Austrian statesman and politician in every encyclopedia The wiki article on the Holy Roman Empire states It was never a nation state Despite the German ethnicity of most of its rulers and subjects from the very beginning many ethnicities constituted the Holy Roman Empire and that is right the Holy Roman Empire WAS NEVER a nation state and it has NO successor Thus Germany cannot claim any person to be a German that has not a specific relationship to it lived predominantly within the borders of 1871 Germany or was born within these borders Another thing you always are saying it is historically correct to speak of Mozart as a German In fact you are entirely wrong here the only historically correct thing to call Mozart would be a citizen of Salzburg and a citizen of the Holy Roman Empire so therefore neither an Austrian nor a German However nations today and this article is about the Germany THAT EXISTS TODAY are proud of people that are associated with their country and therefore want to call them Austrians Germans British etc And with this regard Mozart can only be considered Austrian Until you come up with some serious authority the German wikipedia is not a reliable source and it is nowhere stated there that Mozart was German nor is it stated that he was Austrian German I will keep on deleting Mozart from the article here,0

As with most ethnic groups there are two types of Scottish people men and women each of whom make up 50 Yet this article illustrates Scots with a picture of four men I suggest the illustration needs a couple of women If you had to choose two women to represent Scots who would you choose And which two men would you boot off Robert the Bruce Connery Burns or Bell My personal choice would be Mary Queen of Scots and Muriel Gray and I would boot off Connery and Bell for no real reason I realize any selection will be totally arbitrary but it s something that needs doing and it s an interesting thing to discuss This list of Scottish people may be useful,0
I took out that bowl game as well as the others in an effort to strive for NPOV When I first created the list I was concerned that people would try to add games that were not significant to Notre Dame and college football which was my intent Not all bowl games or BCS games are created equal IF it had been the first BCS game ever or a BCS game that is written about widely i e greatest Bowl games in college football history then I think would be appropriate to add The games listed are of historical significance to Notre Dame and to college football If you had followed each link to every game listed in my edit you would have seen that it went to an independent sports writer or historian that talks about the games in historical terms for college football not just Notre Dame I removed all the bowl games since the section was reoriented to discuss regular season games and since the bowl games are already listed in a table and discussed in a separate section of the article Thus it was not necessary to include them in two places on the same wikipedia page Your reversion abuse of the reversion by labeling it vandalism without first discussing the edit and subsequent reversion by using my admittedly poor word choice against me is I believe in violation of wikiquette and an attempt to start an edit war When I said original research I meant mine as in I included verifiable links to every game listed I understand why you think it could have meant otherwise If you look at the section nothing is plagiarized or in violation of wiki standards But again instead of discussing it on the talk page like I and others have you instead chose to act as the sole editor of the page I thus find your compromise statement in your talk page to be offensive and not in keeping with the spirit of wikipedia If you wish to discuss this on the ND talk page please do so But do not dictate what another editor can or can t do,0
Well the current discussion is the current discussion thats not really my opinion Im not neccisarly looking for support just involvement and in that case neither I was citing it as example of somoen response to your behavior Also im not against you either really as we agree on a lot basics things Such as the need to mention how it was for army recruitment about the moves inst etc really Not that we don t have differences but at least on some core issues No what I was talking about was why Andre left He said it was because of a lack of time or something and I said it was because of the fact his version was protected and because he couldn t give ANY reason however irrelevant why my last edit should have been vandalism or anything else besides a reasonable change But that s history and redundant anyway Sure you were looking for support but not for impartial support Back to topic our versions differences conflict with each other And there can only be ONE article,0

Everything One editor stated during the external link discussion after most people said keep that it didn t matter what the rest voted he d delete it anyway And that s what he did After much debate any many people speaking out on this the article was allowed to stay external link of it starting at March 4th and you can see at least 6 times when it was deleted and then reverted until finally a stub was placed there and people worked on it a bit If the overwhelmingly majority of editors vote to keep something believing it has the right to exists as an article and by consensus the closing editor says keep then an article should be kept,0

I agree that the episodes should be numbered correctly Spring Break Up Goodbye Zoey The Curse of PCA and Chasing Zoey are all one episode and are sold as such As Geraldo mentions take a look at the runtime Amazon has In the cases of the four episodes above runtime is 48 49 minutes which clearly indicate they are one episode If they had something like Chasing Zoey Part 1 24 mins and Chasing Zoey Part 2 24 mins then yeah but they don t because they were packaged as one episode On another related note it s not wise to continue insisting on your edits especially after two people have challenged them If you make an edit and it gets reverted citing something like corrupt numbering which is a legitimate reason the proper thing to do is to take it to the talk page to reach a consensus not revert again I will be reverting the article to before this issue began If the consensus turns to be to label them as a single episode then you ll have to accept it and not continue insisting on your edits,0

Add if you want to and if it would be that long a text we will reduce the content of the Romanian section to basic outlines reference under the main article system and then and only then and if make a new article for Phanariote rules in Romania Also note this article still contains a large part of what was in a Britannica The focus it had on a larger scheme other than the Danubian Principalities is only alluded to in the idea that most would compete for positions of which the ultimate one and usually most treasured office after Dragoman was the title of Prince hence the usual term for a rule in Bucharest or Ia i If what you want to do is an original research that would in fact point to how extremely fluid identities can turn into nationality because by some miracle Orthodox Byzantine becomes Greek which the Phanariotes were not more than they were count me out And again the question of the absurdity of the stubborn post factum nationalism aiming to baptise its ancestors goes for any nationalism including the Romanian one,0

This is a difficult decision as there are many factors that could be considered opinion and original research To my mind it feels correct to cite YouTube videos demonstrating instruments Hank Tambiro Caisa etc that also reference the influence of the Hang This would not be entered in as opinion on the part of the editor here at Wikipedia As has been pointed out earlier in another section of the discussion Wikipedia is not only a hallowed ground where solidified ideas are recorded it is a vibrant and changing community research location To deny newcomers to the Hang the information regarding the offshoots feels like the wrong way to approach the article If there is a separate section titled Hang Influenced Related Instruments it feels like it would be separate from the PANArt creation and the other information in the article Steelpan Related instruments and Tongue Drum Related instruments as sub categories On the other hand it can indeed get to be a bit of a noisy section with everyone who s making their own version of a Hank trying to reference their instrument Please let me know your thoughts,0

Thank you for apologising I think maybe your tagging was ineffective because a lot of people are irritated by tagging which leaves an ugly big complaining box right at the top of a page Always better to bring your issues to the talk page and then you can be far more specific with what you disapprove of tagging rarely makes this clear Show me a diff from when I chastised you please Seriously I d really like to see when I was so awful to you You ve hit the nail on the head perfectly I didn t edit this article looking for praise and appreciation it was because I genuinely wanted to work on it but it does bother me when people start making comments with only negative things to say OhC Wikelvi and presumably you all appreciate Hoffman and have an interest in the article so would it hurt to show some appreciation for our expansion Even if you think there are problems with it would you rather the page went back to this Which version do you think is a better resource So it would just be nice if you could manage Thanks for all the work you ve put into the article but Now going back to the point under discussion I disagree that it s like a shrine for the reasons outlined above I genuinely wouldn t have the article any different if he was still alive and sometimes I wonder if people go the other way and become extra sensitive to anything that could be construed as special attention because he died We must show that his death makes no difference to us Wikipedia has no emotion People will respect us if we show restraint But I just can t see that this is useful to readers I personally think we should make clear what his position was in the film industry and we should give some indication of the reaction to his death Just as we report on his childhood and the roles he played throughout his career these are important elements of his story that I think belong in his article However if there s really several of you who still think it s problematic in light of my comments obviously I m going to attempt to sway you towards my opinion that s not ownership it s just how debating works then something should change I already removed a couple of the quote boxes after this discussion so I m not sure why a certain user is acting like I m so unbendable but I can t read your minds so yes if you re still unhappy it would be best if you just made some changes yourself or at least made specific suggestions Which Jamie has now done since my edit conflict thank you In response I like the theatre one because this element of PSH s career is arguably under covered and it communicates how passionate he was about it which many people don t know but remove it if you disagree,0

It is interesting that you consider the European Quarterly Review a peer reviewed academic historical journal which cites the number of 30 000 Greeks killed in Constantinople as an unacedemical source No one is disputing that these massacres took place The question I am asking which I repeat why should every city town village etc where Turks were killed have a separate section whereas every city town village island where Greeks were killed should not I think we must have one standard to which we create subsections at to me the logical standard is by region not my town Do you agree with me that we have one standard for both massacres of Greeks and massacres of Turks,0

Just a word of advice on talk pages like this you need to indent your comments using colons So the first comment doesn t use any colon Replies to that comment use a single colon at the beginning of their comment Replies to that reply precede their comments with a pair of colons and eqch subsequent reply adds another colon to the start of comment This has the effect of neatly indenting the conversation in sequence making it easy to follow and understand On the substantive point I m not a guardian of the article I m just a wikipedia editor There are no guardians of articles on wikipedia Everyone is equal However there are rules that we all need to follow such as the policies and guidelines and the Manual of Style I and the pther editors commenting here have signposted some of these to you in our comments It might be worthwhile reading and trying to understand some of them because they do affect what you will be able to do here You can of course make ANY changes you want to any article you like The problems arise when the changes you make are not in line with existing policies and style So I can comment on your comments and your contributions and suggest what I think would be acceptable to me and probably many others And you are free to ignore my suggestions and do something completely different if you want but that doesn t mean your changes will be accepted by the community at large or will stay visible on the article for very long Editors might revert your contributions or change them or they might be happy with them and just leave them as is But if they are not you could find yourself blocked again for violating WP 3RR or other disruptive behaviour All I am doing is trying to help You may not see it as help You may not want it But unfortunately for you you can t stop me offering it so long as my behaviour is not considered disruptive by the wider community Which I don t think it is We welcome new editors here on WP especially if they have valuable contributions to make But ingle purpose accounts are not looked on favourably If the only reason you are here is to add your own point of view to this one article then you may find the welcome is less than fulsome If you have a suggestion as to how the article should read it might be worth make the suggestion here on the talk page and getting consensus before adding it to the main article,0

Reading that guideline no one here is claiming that we need to present Amen s his supporters claims as if they were of equal validity with other academic opinions Lobotomy and trepanning are also woo as you put it but as they were immensely popular and influential the topics still dutifully repeat all relevant popular theories about the practice and explain why they were popular using reliable sources Attribution simply needs to be kept clear as day so readers can come to their own conclusions about whether the practice is good or bad Also GEVAL isn t the only guideline that applies here BLP reads Articles should document in a non partisan manner what reliable secondary sources have published about the subjects and in some circumstances what the subjects have published about themselves This I would hope obviously includes actually describing Amen s practices in detail and his motivations instead of simply asserting twenty times that they are unproven,0

Best of Philly Awards fall into several dozen categories which you can find at phillymag com along with the winners by year which usually include Cheesesteaks and possibly one or two others that a cheesesteak purveyor might be eligible for Tony Luke s once won for Best Sports Bar I think But within each category there is usually only one winner never seen more than two sometimes none at all category not listed for that year Philadelphia Magazine gives them a plaque and of course the prominent review in the Awards article both of which they re usually proud to display I definitely think they re worth mentioning especially in articles having a strong Philly connection but I wouldn t use them as the basis for a list of what to include As to Chink s notability I wasn t the one who added it to the list here but I think its longevity gives it some credevidently the store hasn t changed since it opened over 50 years ago making it kind of a landmark which I think is more of a reason to list a store here than whether its steaks are good Chink s also serves as a prominent example of a store that doesn t offer Whiz or provolone to counter what some experts have opined here as to what constitutes a proper cheesesteak Furthermore it s well north of South Street And I wholeheartedly agree with you about the unsourced opinions here This is getting out of hand We need to come to a consensus on what Steak shops we are going to put on this page I think 3 or 4 have been added in the last day or two Given enough time maybe every shop in Philly can be listed Why not add in the suburbs too and make this article absolutely massive I recommend Pat s and Geno s maybe Jim s and Tony Lukes and if other s want to mention their local places then start another page for Cheesesteak shops in Philadelphia or something to that affect Interested to hear other people s thoughts These lists are always problematic Most most unbaised way to deal with it is to have no list at all Of course I agree that a short select list would be ideal but understand that it will get new additions from now until forever because there are always new Wikipedia users I suggest Pat s and Geno s period I imagine that sources can be found that cite these two in particular as the famous ones or the rivals or the tourist traps I maintain that everyone will agree that those two need to be included and nobody will agree on the others I d also accept a simple list of cheesesteak establishments that have won the Best of Philly award Notice that Steve s and Chink s Jim s and Tony Luke s and Larry s and Mama s and Explorer s Den have no source citations at all Pat s and Geno s aren t very well sourced in their own sections but are mentioned in sourced items elsewhere for example the Kerry contretemps took place at Pat s BillFlis says Chink s and Tony Luke s have won Best of Philly awards although he hasn t sourced this which might be used to warrant inclusion I gave the source of the Best of Philly Awards as phillymag org Weren t you able to find them Do I have to spoonfeed you the URLs of the individual pages Sheesh Go to the library At least what I put is verifiable if not by a lazy person like yourself Just about the rest of what s here is complete crap the opinings of armchair experts with no credentials except a claim of being native Philadelphians oh what an ignorant bunch we are let alone signatures OTOH I don t think winning a BoP Award is enough for inclusion here a shop should have a sort of landmark statuslongevity popularity which without some survey has gotta be POV whatever I have no problem with Pat s and Geno stourists know their names even before they come to town for better or worse I add Let s leave out the discussion of which one is better that s entirely POV unless you mention a BoP Award which has a shred of legitimacy Who listens to critics anyway And I mean professional critics not the slobs here Also I cited a bunch of links about Chink s that cited original links that were no longer valid what can I do I still think they had some foundation unlike most of this article Sorry if I picked on you but I m a bit frustrated by this article too I was able to find many references to Pat s and Geno s as a famous pair I was also able to find many Web references probably none qualifying as reliable sources that ring many changes on the tourist trap theme They re tourist traps in recent years locals have come to regard them as tourist traps despite their reputation as tourist traps they re good etc etc I wouldn t even bring up the tourist trap issue it s entirely POV With carefully crafted wording however it might be possible to subtly convey that idea but it would never stand up to the ceaseless editing by the ham handed editors we have here some of whom think those places are absolutely fabulous mainly because they provide sustenance to drunks at 3am OK I did the deed I hope those URLs actually work They seem to work for me Now friends this is why we need citations The article has said for a very long time Steve s Prince of Steaks The shop has won the Best of Philly Award for Best Cheesesteak Shop several times and is patronized by many Northeast Philadelphians But the link to the hollyeats website while giving Steve s high marks five grease stains says nothing about Best of Philly Now the actually Best of Philly section of is a bear to navigate and can only be searched one year at a time I clicked on every year and searched on the word cheesesteak Unless I missed something Steve s never came up So they may have won a Best of Philly award but not for a category containing the word cheesesteak Unless as I say I missed something Can anyone confirm what year s Steve s won Best of Philly and for what Passyunk Ave Is it pronounced Passy Unk three syllables or Pass Yunk two Well both ways you have it are 2 syllables I don t know i have always pronounced it Pass y unk though when i say it has a tendency to come out Pass y yunk and y usually sounds like a e but i could be wrong i have a tendency to pronounce come things a bit quirky I ahvbe also herd it pronounced like Pasie Unk or Passa

Alright you asked for thoughts so I m giving them to you and they will be long Honestly I don t like alot of the changes you re making I like some but I dislike just as many if not more Shrug IMO This list isn t the official handbook to the marvel universe nor does it have to adhere to it so strictly I liked the way the list was set up much better before you started changing it for the most part but again not completely See it gets hard I like that characters like X Force The New Mutants The Young X Men are on there characters who I feel have been around a while gone on missions adhered to Xavier s Dream as it were Those characters I feel have earned a place on the list if you get my drift I support including them I have no problem believing that these characters would be considered X Men by their peers I hate however including people like Lady Mastermind Mystique who were never sincerely members just spies Sabretooth who was never even willingly a member Petra Sway who were just BS retconned into being members before characters we ve been reading for 40 years now and died just as quickly The Science Squad a bunch of lab coats who don t really go on missions and are there more for research opportunities than to be X Men and who just kind of hang out around the real members and the 100 mutants who came from fleeting stories like X Corp Manifest Destiny Exodus that introduce characters like Stringfellow Darkstar Fantomex Ariel to the team fleetingly and give people the impression that they re full fledged X Men even though they barely assist the team for one mission and then disapear it s asinine I mean ideally I d like for this list to be approached with a certain element of common sense Ya know When we decide who or who doesn t belong there and approached with a bit less This person must or must not be included because this book says they are or aren t an X Man Comic books are not infallible They frequently contradict themselves and will probably continue to do so for decades to come I hate that the rules the handbook places on things exclude a character like X Man or Domino from the main list but include people like Ariel or Sabretooth I d consider X Man an X Man long before I d consider Ariel one Like I said I wish we could just approach the list with a little more common sense WE read these stories WE see inside ALL the characters heads WE know their motivations WE see their intent Deep down WE all know which ones are or aren t X Men The way I approach the question of Who is an X Man is usually this Let s say there s a pretty tribute wall in the X Mansion where we hang up pictures of all the X Men to look fondly upon and reflect over the years Now my question is If I were the headmaster at the Xavier Institute would I hang a picture of this mutant on that wall The answer for a guy like Sabretooth No Anole Yes Lady Mastermind No X Man Yes Vulcan No Karma Yes Fantomex No The Cuckoos Yes Was Sabreooth an X Man in one writers head Yeah probably Was Sabretooth an X Man according to the paperwork in Marvel s records Yeah probably Was Sabretooth ever an X Man in SPIRIT No Not at all We can all see plain as day that Sabretooth was never onboard with the team Every writer that comes into these books these days seems to apply a blanket recruitment to every stupid mutant that strolls in and out of his book There are like about 200 lame mutants that can lay claim to the name X Men these days and I hate that we have to sit here and argue about who is or isn t actually a member and wait until Marvel tells us what to do instead of use common sense Now all that said do I have answers for you No It s obviously a very debatable point of discussion who should or shouldn t be on the list Honestly I think it s one we won t ever resolve So if you wanna make all these changes go ahead I m not gonna stop you I don t have the energy for major edits right now but I promise you eventually someone will have the energy and someone will edit them back into something you don t like down the line Hell there s a good chance I ll be that someone down the road once I get a bit more freetime I know I ve moved the Deadly Genesis team off the list at least 3 times now and will continue to do so since as I ve made quite clear I don t think they belong there I just ask that when someone DOES change something and they will I ask that when someone changes something don t just undo their changes and say I m undoing it because this is what the handbook says Really Stop Read over the change Ask yourself if it makes sense And if it does just roll with it If the change makes sense it makes another user happy and it doesn t violate the rules set forth by Wikipedia does it really NEED to adhere to the Marvel Handbook REALLY Why start an edit war Use common sense P,0

Additional unusual behaviors observed for WTC2 included the correlated smoke puffs observed over large areas of the fa ade and over the roughly one minute periods during which the smoke flows increased DRAMATICALLY often accompanied by external flames These events were usually most evident on the 79th and 80th floors of the east face but could often be detected on other floors and faces as well At least 65 occurrences of smoke puffs were documented along with 7 times when the one minute long smoke releases took place The evidence suggests that these smoke puffs resulted from PRESSURE PULSES generated within the tower and transmitted to other locations It is considered likely while these pressure pulses were of sufficient magnitude to affect smoke flows over multiple floors they were much too small to affect the tower s structural components For most of the smoke puffs there was no visual indication of the event that generated the pressure pulse or its location In a few cases such as when WHEN MOLTEN METAL POURED from the tower circumstantial evidence indicated that the puffs WERE ASSOCIATED with specific observed events NIST NCSTAR 1 5 WTC Investigation p p 36 38 The video shot from the WTC plaza captured an INTRIGUING event at 9 37 04 a m A jet of air dust and A LARGE PIECE OF DEBRIS WAS EJECTED from a window 77 355 on the 77th floor at AN EXTREMELY HIGH VELOCITY Longer distance videos show that puffs of smoke and or dust appeared simultaneously on the east face from several open windows near the center of the 78th floor and from open windows on the north side of the 79th floor Interestingly the smoke flow from the windows on the west sides of the 79th and 80th floors which had decreased markedly by this time did not increase Within 14s of this release a large fire either grew or became visible near the center of the east face on the 82nd floor A long distance video shot from the south showed that fire and smoke were pushed from multiple locations on the south face at the same time the strong jet occurred on the 77th floor of the east face NIST NCSTAR 1 5A WTC Investigation p 346 It has been reported in the FEMA report McAllister 2002 as well as in the media that what appeared to be MOLTEN METAL WAS OBSERVED POURING from the north face near the northeast corner prior to the collapse of WTC2 This is the area where the sustained fires on the 81st and 82nd had been burning since the aircraft impact The likely explanation for the observation of pouring liquid is that the material had originally pooled on the floor slab above i e the 81st floor and that it was allowed to pour out of the building when the floor slab in the immediate vicinity either pulled away from the spandrel or sank down to the point where the window was exposed The puff of smoke and or dust just prior to the release of the material occurred suddenly in the process creating a PRESSURE PULSE that forced smoke and or dust out of open windows over three floors There was another release of smoke and or dust from near the east edge of the north face at 9 52 38 a m Immediately afterward the spot near the top of window 80 255 brightened considerably At 9 52 47 a m a series of three much LARGER PRESSURE PULSES which took place over 35s pushed smoke and or dust from several locations on multiple floors of the north face These locations included those described above the two areas on the north side of the 83rd floor where fires were burning the vicinity of the pile of debris near the center of the 79th floor an area of newly observed fire on the 79th floor near windows 79 209 to 79 213 and the opening of the northeast corner of the 81st floor The fire burning near the center of the 79th floor flared up noticeably Immediately following one of the pressure pulses at 9 52 48 a m intense flames suddenly reappeared in windows 91 301 and 81 302 on the east face just to the south of the northeast corner of the 81st floor At roughly the same time part of the debris lodged at the northeast corner of the 81st floor fell out of the opening Relatively small amounts of MOLTEN MATERIAL POURED from window 80 255 NEAR THE START AND THE END OF THE series of PRESSURE PULSES Videos show that smoke was also expelled from windows near the north edges of the 79th and 80th floors of the east face during these pressure pulses NISTNCSTAR 1 5A Chapter 9 Appendix C p p 375 376 pdf p p 79 89 At 9 53 41 a m and 9 53 46 a m two pressure pulses forced additional smoke from windows on the north face Both of these occurrences were ACCOMPANIED BY SHORT FLOWS OF MOLTEN MATERIAL from the same window 80 255 on the 80th floor observed earlier The largest flow occurred during the second release Figure 9 75 shows a view of the northeast corner of WTC2 taken from a video at 9 53 51 a m The BRIGHT MOLTEN STREAM flowing from the top of windows 80 255 IS PROMINENT An image of the north face taken at 9 55 18 a m is shown in Figure 9 76 The image was shot 1 min 45s after the one shown in Figure 9 74 The fire distributions are very similar in the two photographs with the exception of the fire on the 82nd floor to the right of the cold spot in Figure 9 76 As discussed above the fire was first observed at 9 53 47 a m burning in windows 82 234 to 82 337 At 9 55 18 a m flames were visible in windows 82 231 to 82 236 and flames were coming out of windows 82 233 The bright spot at the top of window 80 255 is visible on the 80th floor but there is no obvious molten liquid flow at this time Unlike in the earlier photograph fire is now visible in the adjacent window 80 256 During the next several minutes following the two pressure pulses around 9 53 45 a m numerous pressure pulses were noted that pushed smoke from open windows on the north and east faces of WTC2 A particularly STRONG PRESSURE PULSE started at 9 56 11 a m It lasted nearly 10s This particular pulse was strong enough to push flames from the tower at many locations Following a pressure pulse at 9 56 31 a m the flames present on the 81st floor in the northeast corner opening and nearby flames on the north face abruptly died down The large flame in window 81 301 on the east face also declined within 2s All of these flames reappeared after a few seconds At 9 57 21 a m shortly after another pressure pulse the BRIGHT LIGHT reappeared at the top window 80 255 on the 80th floor from which the FLOW OF MOLTEN METAL had been observed earlier Almost immediately it appeared to jump one window to the east i e to window 80 256 Five seconds later a LIGHT FLOW OF MOLTEN METAL began pouring out of window 80 256 THE FLOW OF MATERIAL from this window WOULD NOW BE NEARLY CONTINUOUS UNTIL THE TOWER COLLAPSED At 9 57 32 a m there was a fairly intense pressure pulse within the tower THE FLOW RATE OF THE MOLTEN METAL INCREASED DRAMATICALLY at this time p 383 pdf p 87 Figure 9 77 is a frame from a video that was shot at 9 57 45 a m It shows the falling metal as it was approaching the ground THE LARGE AMOUNT of falling material IS EVIDENT Most of the molten metal seems to have broken up into small droplets but there are a couple of large pieces falling as well Apparently the material flowing out of window 80 256 also included pieces of debris that had not fully melted There was another HEAVY FLOW OF MOLTEN METAL at 9 58 35 a m p 384 pdf p 88 Numerous visual observations suggest that IMPORTANT CHANGES which might have had STRUCTURAL RELEVANCE were taking place in WTC2 in the period following aircraft impact until collapse These observations include hanging objects some of which based on appearance may have been locally dislodged floor slabs that had settled down to locations below the spandrel at several locations on the north and east faces changes in positions of the hanging objects during the period the occurrence of numerous PRESSURE PULSES identified by smoke and or dust puffs generated over multiple windows and floors the appearance

While a lot of wrestling articles on Wikipedia e g about Ric Flair or Bret Hart or Barry Windham or even Sting mention about their popularity influence skills and about them being considered one of the finest wrestlers ever the Undertaker s page hardly mentions anything about it except that he is a senior performer in the first page Let s face it we all know that the Undertaker is highly skilled because despite his huge size he has executed wrestling moves which nobody in the WWE has done he can walk the top rope he can do the suicide dive flying vertically over the top rope he has used many finishers and introduced some of them in the WWE like the tombstone piledriver the chokeslam the last ride the triangle choke the gogoplata the dragon sleeper etc He is the longest lasting signed athlete in the history of the WWE and he has featured in more PPVs for the WWE than any other wrestler That s why the WWE always mention about the evolution and adaptation of the Undertaker in their articles as well as TV shows and he is called as the best pure striker in the history of the business and the most dominant force in the history of the business The Undertaker is associated with some of the most memorable matches in WWE history including the Hell In A Cell match with Shawn Michaels which is 1 out of the only 4 matches which received a 5 star rating from Dave Meltzer of Wrestling Observer Newsletter and also with some of the most memorable moments He has survived across various eras of wrestling and stood in the ring with opponents of all sizes and varied skill sets in all types of matches be it Hell In A Cell Inferno Casket etc Considering the amount of effort which the Undertaker has put more into the business by being locker room leader by carrying the torch during the lean years of the WWE by mentoring other superstars and also by helping other characters like Kane get derived out of his character and gain superstar status with a more successful career than earlier I think it needs to be called out in some or the other form in this article There is a reason why he is called the Phenom and the Conscience of the WWE and why he was voted as the greatest athlete in the history of Raw by the fans Can we at least mention some of these facts not necessarily in the same format as below in the article s 1st paragraph or in a separate sub section like Popularity or Wrestling Style and Influence or General Impression or Fan Peer Opinion for which I am also posting reliable sources He is the locker room leader backstage a source from a WWF com interview first para Another interview link on this from Undertaker On the Score Part 1 Part 2 also mentions about him carrying the torch during the lean years of the business He is the longest signed athlete with the WWE a source from a WWF com interview first para He is one of the most respected athletes backstage a source from a WWF com interview the link says he is the most respected athlete in the history of the business but for the sake of this article I am suggesting we simply use one of the most Another link on this from This is My Yard DVD released by WWE in which superstars talk about the Undertaker There was another interview link in which Kurt Angle said We as WWE wrestlers think he s the greatest ever however I am unable to find that link right now I will try to find it and post it Another link here from Jim Ross blog states that in the last 34 years of his career he has not seen a wrestler who has gained more respect of his peers than the Undertaker and this is a fan site however it points to a reliable link on JR s blog Let me know your thoughts on this,0

Sorry Keith I do apologise I can see now where this has all sprung up from it s a great misunderstanding I had incorrectly assumed that because you used the language of a scientist and spoke with such authority that you might actually be one But if you don t have a PhD even though I have three then no wonder you re unable to work within the field although I have all my adult life publish peer reviewed articles although I ve been published in seven languages in over 150 countries obtain grant funding even though I have or collaborate with others even though I am doing so continuously and have done so for many years We ve all been addressing you as a fellow scientist even though you re not one yourself when in reality you are a layman even though I m not I m very sorry for the confusion this must have caused you we will all endeavour to explain the way of the world in simpler terms from here on Never mind Wimpy Why should you let your complete ignorance and disregard of the facts get in the way of your motivated and childish abuse,0

additional comment the following passage was in significant part added by the Jain contributer After I asked for comments it was left unchanged and has remained so ever since but I must admit I ve never been happy with its assertions about ignorant artists etc The left facing swastika is generally regarded as evil in Hindu tradition The much more common form in India is the right facing swastika Indians of all faiths rarely use the symbol in both orientations although Buddhists outside India can use the left facing swastika Sometimes examples are said to be found of left facing swastikas in India These are invariably an unintended or ignorant mistake by the decorator or sculptor who created the left facing swastika,0

SW sorry to be picky but I think you mean Epic is a legitimate genre description not used as a subjective evaluation here It can be a evaluative term comparable to majestic Unlike romantic vs romance epic can be both a legit genre description AND a evaluative judgment implying majestic of great magnitude and or heroic depending on context Often when used the latter way it is not in relationship to literature at all such as talking about the epic events of the World War of Scott s epic trip to the North Pole I suspect probably the person s who keep deleting it are confusing the two senses of the word rather than denying that the film belongs in the genre,0

Many different opinions have been given when it comes to their ethnic make up A more concrete evidence of the Albanian Pelasgian origin is supplied by the study of the Albanian language Notwithstanding certain points of resemblance in structure and phonetics the Albanian language is entirely distinct from the tongues spoken by the neighboring natonalities This language is particularly interesting as the only surviving representative of the so called Thraco Ilyrian group of languages which formed the primitive speech of the inhabitants of the Balkan Peninsula The French author Zacharie Mayani 1899 put forth a thesis that the Etruscan language had links to the Albanian language This thesis places the Albanian language outside the group of Indo European languages sharing one branch with EtruscansOther sources that support the Etruscan and Pelasgian connection with Albanians Nermin Vlora Falaschi L Etrusco lingua viva Roma Bardi 1989 as well as ancient Greek Pelasg An ancient form of Albanian The French author Zacharie Mayani Nermin Vlora Falaschi published a translation of the Lemnos stele on this basis with the help of Arvanite Albanian The theory is supported by Falaschi Catapano Marchiano Mathieu ArefMathieu Aref Albanie ou l incroyable odyss e d un peuple pr hell nique 2003 Faverial D Angely KoliasAristeid P Kollia Arvanites kai h katag g t n Hell n n historik laographik politistik gl ssologik episkopis Athens A P Kollias 1985 i e 1986 and Cabej support this point of view Dionysius of Halicarnassus Roman Antiquities Book 1 17 LacusCurtius Ovid Metamorphoses Book 12 1 Perseus Strabo Geography Book v 2 4 LacusCurtius It is estimated that of the actual stock of the Albanian language more than one third is of undisputed Ilyrian origin and the rest are Ilyrian Pelasgian ancient Greek and Latin with a small admixture of Slavic Italian dating from the Venetian occupation of the seaboard and some Celtic words too The most active supporter of this theory was Austrian linguist Hahn who attempted to connect the pre Indo European Pelasgian language with Albanian Today however Albanian is universally classified as an Indo European language by linguists,0
What utter gall You have a whole section of your user page devoted to a nasty personal attack on me and you expect that people here are only going to notice when you put on your sweet syrupy persona to mask the other side of your interaction with me as an editor When I asked you to remove this personal attack to show good faith you replaced a few childish words see diff You and your friends turned my User talk page into a battleground over this page and related pages This is just a partial list of your attacks on me rather than good faith editing And yet you pretend you want to limit the disucssion to substance It s way too late to pretend Please let s just ask for outside comments,1

I did t mean to be funny but I am glad you liked it Now to make sure you are not laughing for the wrong reasons Waterloo Modern Dutch spelling would be Waterlo there are hundreds of place names in Flanders and the Netherlands ending in lo or loo really does mean Water Wood or better Wood near some water of course That loo in French is pronounced in the same way as l eau is pure coincidence With King William I was comma to avoid ambiguity of course being a bit too concise I meant of course the Prince of Orange who would later become King William II but no longer of Belgium since after 1830 Belgium seceded and Waterloo was no longer home for him The battle of Quatre Bras is really called De slag bij Vier Armen in most Dutch history books Of course this is the English Wikipedia we typically only mention variants like that in the article on the place itself not in all articles on a treaty signed or a battle fought there But switching from Dutch to French in one and the same English Wikipedia article also sounds a bit strange Again thanks But someone who knows French phonetics should correct this reference to the pronunciation otherwise it should be deleted as irrelevant,0

This section about North Africa is not talking especially about J1 but says Arabic and Berber speaking populations in Africa seem to have received migrations of men from the Middle East possibly Arabic So this extremely inaccurate as most historians agree that Phoenician and Jewish migrations to North Africa were very likely more important than Arab migrations So if you refer to genetic studies that talk about J1 in North Africa in this case you must write something like this Regarding J1 contribution to North Africa it could be due to Arab migrations,0

It does not matter what Google says internet sources are notoriously unreliable especially websites with domains ending in com or org I have found a print source from a reputable nonfiction publisher which clearly states that Herodotus calls Thales a Phoenician by remote descent but that the later historian Diogenes Laertius after quoting this from Herodotus remarks that most of his sources agree that Thales was actually from a distinguished native Milesian family I have adjusted the information in the article to reflect this fact giving full details of what the source says I would like to know why you keep reverting my edit in which I state that Herodotus describes Thales as a Phoenician by remote descent but that Diogenes Laertius after quoting this statement from Herodotus rejects it stating that most of his sources agreed that Thales was born of a distinguished native Milesian family I have provided a good source for this information but you have provided absolutely no source explanation or reason for why you do not think this information should be included It looks to me as though you are simply refusing to accept any sources regardless of how reliable those sources may be that contradict your pre held conception of Thales as a Phoenician immigrant I am not trying to attack you but I would like to know your reasoning I cannot understand why you seem to regard my information as invalid,0
And editor is putting that information off balance to make it look like the movement is widespread and taken seriously without adding the rest of the story line from the article I readded the information If that editor and another have a problem with that info best to discuss here and not remove since consensus says it is o k Using the idea of weight really does not apply Especially since the same editor used a partial quote to make a point and disconnected the later part apparently not to have the point developed fully but to keep it at the snippet and disconnected from the whole level There is clear consensus from other areas above to use the Goldberg material and I suggest the editor self revert since this smacks now of edit jousting does the article no good twists the information and makes it unreliable to partially give an idea without including the bigger aspect,0

Bulgars also called Bulgarians were one of the three ethnic ancestors of modern Bulgarians the other two were Thracians and Slavs The origin and homeland of the Bulgarian tribes are still subjects of research generating many hypothesis and violent disputes They were mentioned for the first time in 354 AD by Anonymous Roman Chronograph as people living north of the Caucasus mountain and west of the Volga River Headed by their chieftan Vund they invaded Europe with the Huns about 370 AD and retreating with the Huns about 460 AD they resettled in the area north and east of the Sea of Azov Bulgar Vund or Utigur vh ndur Vanand is the name used by historians and geographers like Moses Horenaci Procopius Caesariensis and his continuators Agathias of Mirena Menander Protector and Theophylact Simocatta in the 6th century to refer the eastern branch of the Hunno Bulgars who were the successors of the Hunnic empire along the coasts of the Black Sea in Patria Onoguria The Huns Rome and the Birth of Europe 2013 Hyun Jin Kim page 57 After a period of chaos following Attila s death dualism again reasserted itself in the succession of Dengitzik and Ernak west and east respectively The successor to the Hunnic Empire in the east or rather probably the coninuation also featured two wings the Kutrigurs west and the Utigurs east ruled presumably by Ernak s descendants The late antique historians use the names of Huns Bulgars Kutrigurs and Utrigurs as interchangeable terms The Huns Rome and the Birth of Europe Hyun Jin Kim page 256 Thus in our sources the names Kutrigur Bulgar and Hun are used interchangeably and refer in all probability not to separate groups but one group Saatchi Early Mediaeval identity of the Bulgarians page 3 The early Byzantine texts use the names of Huns Bulgarians Kutrigurs and Utrigurs as interchangeable terms There the Bulgarians are represented as identical they are a part of Huns or at least have something common with them The khans Avtiochol and Irnik listed in the Nominalia of the Bulgarian khans today are identified with Attila and Ernach of the Hunno Bulgarian Loan Words in Slavic Antoaneta Granberg Introduction 2 the data are insufficient to clearly distinguish Huns Avars and Bulgars one from another REMARKS ON THE CHINESE BULGAR 2004 SANPING CHEN In fact contemporary European sources kept equating the Bulgars with the Huns At the very least the Hun Bulgar connection was much more tangible than the Hun Xiongnu identification History of the Later Roman Empire J B Bury The Kotrigurs who were a branch of the Hunnic race occupied the steppes of South Russia from the Don to the Dniester and were probably closely allied to the Bulgarians or Onogundurs the descendants of Attila s Huns who had their homes in Bessarabia and Walachia They were a formidable people and Justinian had long ago taken precautions to keep them in check in case they should threaten to attack the Empire though it was probably for the Roman cities of the Crimea Cherson and Bosporus that he feared rather than for the Danubian provinces As his policy on the Danube was to use the Lombards as a check on the Gepids so his policy in Scythia was to use another Hunnic people the Utigurs as a check on the Kotrigurs The Utigurs lived beyond the Don on the east of the Sea of Azov and Justinian cultivated their friendship by yearly gifts Encyclopedia of the Byzantine Empire Jennifer Lawler Utigurs Hunnic tribe that lived on the east steppes of Don related to the Bulgars 296 Walls and Linear Barriers Peter Spring In 460 the Huns split into the Onogurs Utigurs and Kotrigurs 199 history of the First Bulgarian Empire Book I THE CHILDREN OF THE HUNS Steven Runciman 5 On Attila s death his empire crumbled His people who had probably been only a conglomeration of kindred tribes that he had welded together divided again into these tribes and each went its own way One of these tribes was soon to be known as the Bulgars thus prompting some modern historians to coin the term Hunno Bulgars Pritsak 1982 pages 435 448 449 According to Procopius Agathias and Menander Utigurs and their relatives Kutrigurs were Huns they were dressed in the same way and had the same language O Maenchen Helfen The World of the Huns page 378 In one instance we are explicitly told that the Kutrigur and Utigur called Huns by Procopius Agathias and Menander were of the same stock dressed in the same way and had the same language Hunno Bulgarian Language 2008 Antoaneta Granberg G teborg University The Hunno Bulgarian language was formed on the Northern and Western borders of China in the 3rd 5th c BC The analysis of the loan words in Slavonic language shows the presence of direct influences of various language families Turkic Mongolian Chinese and Iranian The Huns and Proto Bulgarians spoke the same language different from all other barbarian languages When Turkic tribes appeared at the borders of the Chinese empire in the 6th c the Huns and Proto Bulgarians were no longer there It is important to note that Turkic does contain Hunno Bulgarian loans but that these were received through Chinese intermediary e g Hunnic ch eng li sky heaven was borrowed from Chinese as t ngri in Turkic The Hunno Bulgarian language exhibits non Turkic and non Altaic features Altaic has no initial consonant clusters while Hunno Bulgarian does Unlike Turkic and Mongolian Hunno Bulgarian language has no initial dental or velar spirants Unlike Turkic it has initial voiced b bagatur a title boyla a title Unlike Turkic Hunno Bulgarian has initial n which is also encountered in Mongolian Negun Nebul proper names In sum Hunno Bulgarian language has no consistent set of features that unite it with either Turkic or Mongolian Neither can it be related to Sino Tibetian languages because it obviously has no monosyllabic word structure Kutrigurs and Onogurs were in all likelihood identical with the Bulgars page 141 Many historians consider Utigurs and Kutrigurs as successors of the Hunnic empire in the east on the territory of modern day Ukraine where the Huns retreated after the death of Attila The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire Volume 4 Edward Gibbon page 537 And both Procopius and Agathias represent Kotrigurs and Utigurs as tribes of Huns There can be no doubt Kutrigurs Utigurs and Bulgars belong to the same race as the Huns of Attila and spoke tongues closely related were in fact Huns They had all been under Attila s dominion Huns Rome and the Birth of Europe 2013 Hyun Jin Kim page 57 page 138 page 140 141 page 254 That the Utigurs and Kutrigurs formed the two main wings of the same steppe confederacy is proved by the foundation legend told by Procopius regarding the ethnogenesis of the two tribal groupings He states that before the formation of both entities power in the steppe was concentrated in the hands of a single ruler presumably he is referring here to Ernak son of Attila who then divided the power empire between his two sons called Utigur and Kutrigur Justinian and Theodora Robert Browning page 160 The Huns of Attila and their descendants the Bulgars the Kutrigurs and the Utigurs were pastoral peoples of the steppe and semi desert lands of central Asia who had been driven westwards in search of new pastures by a combination of factors The progressive desiccation of their ancient home and in particular of the Tarim Basin reduced the grazing land available Menander Protector mentioned an Utigur leader in the latter 6th century called Sandilch Menandri Fragmenta Excerpta de legationibus Ed C de Boor Berolini 1903 p 170 Later these Bulgars of the Eurasian steppes had come under the control of the Western Turkic Kaghanate and were also known as Unogundur Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland 1971 Volume 3 page 459 Utigur and Unnugari are used as common synonyms for the same tribe Again the Unnugari are also called Unugunduri and Unungunduri In the early 7th century Khan Kubrat of the Dulo clan was ruler of the Unogundurs and the founder of Old Great Bulgaria Nisephorus Patriarcha Breviarium Ed C de Boor p 24 The Bulgar ancestors of the Utigurs represented the Pontic Kuban part of the Hun Empire and were ruled by descendants of Attila through his son Ernakh The Huns Rome and the Birth of Europe 2013 Hyun Jin Kim page 140 The same is likely to have been the case among the Utigurs and Kutrigurs who under Attilid rule had even more justification for claiming the imperial mantle of the Huns of Europe Who were the Huns Roman historians Themistius 317 390 Claudian 370 404 and later Procopius 500 560 called the Huns Massagetae The World of the Huns Otto Maenchen Helfen page 4 But considering that Themistius Claudian and later Procopius called the Huns Massagetae The Huns were called Massagetae also by Ambrose 340 397 Ausonius 310 394 Synesius 373 414 Zacharias Rhetor 465 535 Belisarius 500 565 Evagrius

between the proto Bulgarians and the Altaic and Central Asian Turkic speaking populations either did not exist or was negligible Y Chromosome Diversity in Modern Bulgarians New Clues about Their Ancestry Sena Karachanak et al History According to Procopius there was a nation of Huns living to the east of the Sea of Azov and north of the Caucasus the king of these Huns had two sons Kutigur and Utigur The king referred by Procopius is most probably Ernak the third son of Attila After the death of the king the two sons divided the people into two tribes Analyzing the chronicles of the antique historians Vasil Zlatarski concludes that the name Bulgar was used for both tribes but in 6th century the tribal names were preferred by the Eastern Roman Empire due to the different policy it had toward these two tribes page 75 In the middle of 6th century the Emperor Justinian being attacked by the Kutrigurs under their leader Chinialus bribed their relatives the Utigurs led by Sandilch to attacked the Kutrigurs in the rear The resulting internecine war between the two tribes weakened them and made them vulnerable to the Avar attack shortly after that The Huns Rome and the Birth of Europe Hyun Jin Kim page 142 By 568CE some Kutrigurs groups came under the control of the Varchonites who were migrating to Pannonia and was also known as Avars The eastern Bulgar groups along the northern coasts of the Black sea the Utigurs were conquered by the Western Turkic Kaghanate who were violently opposed to the Pannonian Avars Due to civil war the Western Turks retreated back into Asia no later than 583 CE according to Zlatarski Kubrat s Utigurs defeated the Avars in alliance with Byzantium and reunited the Utigurs and Kutrigurs into a single Crimean Bulgar confederation in

I regret that you reverted my edit and I hope other editors will also look at it I believe its sources are better and its phrasing follows the sources more strictly What Diogenes Laertius actually said was Now Thales as Herodotus and Douris and Democritus say was the son of Examyes as father and Cleobuline as mother from the descendants of Theleus who are Phoenicians nobles from the line of Cadmus and Agenor and he Agenor was enrolled as a citizen in Miletus when he came with Neileus when the latter was exiled from Phoenicia But most people say that Thales was a true Milesian by descent and of high family That s quoted in one of the sources that you destroyed along with the original Greek Rather than saying way more sources maybe you d like to point to them I have yet to see any evidence for the consensus that the article says is there in the version that you have reverted to,0

Once again you have inserted random references to support your assertion that Austrians glossed over predictions or cherry picked from their own It is unfortunate that you are not able or willing to provide a source for what you claim is unchalengable Just because your original research is well founded does not mean that you are now able to add that to a Wikipedia article and have it remain when challenged If you believe that my removal of your original research constitutes an edit war then I encourage you to report the matter,0
The wording specifically stated it was a settlement how does that imply a court ordered ruling We can t deny the context of the pyramid allegations Minkow s report started the controversy and the controversy is prominent enough in the company s history to be included in the lead Other critics echoed his report shortly after its release and there hasn t been anything since Minkow removed his report For a company that has been in business for close to 20 years the 18 months of scrutiny that stemmed from Minkow s report is significant but must be taken within context,0
To view Austrian as somehow distinct and mutually exclusive from German before 1866 is simply wrong up until that point every German speaking Austrian can most certainly be described as a German just as much as any Bavarian or any W rttemberger or any Hessian and more so than German speaking inhabitants of East Prussia which was never part of the Germanic Confederation or the Holy Roman Empire As to other points yes Alsatians before 1648 would be and generally are considered to be Germans So are Swiss Germans before the 14th century or so and so forth The Czechs are obviously a special case because not only were they not German speaking but the Kingdom of Bohemia was in some sense a specifically Czech political unit within a larger German political unit So things get complicated there A place like the Duchy of Lorraine would also be complicated It is not complicated at all for Italian lands in the Holy Roman Empire or the Kingdom of Arles because these areas were never considered part of Germany The Holy Roman Empire had three parts the Kingdom of Germany the Kingdom of Italy and the Kingdom of Arles Burgundy The latter two would never have been considered German At any rate of course Mozart was German although he was Austrian too although I too would hesitate to call him Austrian based on his birth in Salzburg not then a Habsburg possession Let me add that many figures originally from areas not in modern Austria made their lives in Vienna prior to 1866 Among others Metternich was a Rhineland prince Beethoven was from Bonn The Habsburgs themselves came originally from Switzerland But so yes anyone from the modern country of Austria except the Burgenland which was part of Hungary who lived before 1866 can most definitely be called a German and in many contexts probably should To act as though Austria was a distinct nation before 1866 or that the boundaries of the modern Republic of Austria mean anything before 1918 is a complete anachronism,0

Right since Abd feels all editors must agree to obtain consensus which is clearly not going to happen here I ll succinctly put my objections to the main remaining issues 1 the inclusion of the condemnatory words by the Church Committee CC and 2 the Deke DeLoach DD seating affair The CC s words related to the actions of many people over many years As far as I know none of the WP pages relating to these people carry the CC judgements so why should the Moyers page unless a POV is getting pushed The DD affair about convention seating amounts to a relatively unknown incident that DD claims happened Now immediately that raises red flags we are not supposed to be reporting little known facts on BLP pages especially so if the fact is derogatory If you don t know that you ought to read the rules more carefully And quite apart from that the page on Regnery Publishing shows that it is simply a right wing front organisation e g the same people who published the Swift Boat smear Read the Regnery Publishing talk page Everyone knows that Regnery is one of the major purveyors of books by right wing attack dogs like Anne Coulter and G Gordon Liddy What they choose to publish about one of their greatest enemies Moyers is not for inclusion here when it comes only from one man Deke Deloach who only became deputy director of the FBI in 1965 so he was not 3 at the time and who according to Ronald Kessler in The Bureau The Secret History of the FBI once attempted to blackmail Senator Carl T Hayden This is not a reliable source And even if by some miracle this incident actually did happen it is simply not notable prima facie because Moyers was merely a conduit for LBJ s orders and because the order was not enacted,0
As I have mentioned previously I think part of fixing this article requires expanding non controversial portions of this article to give a clearer picture of Alicia Machado outside of events of the last few months For example there is no early life section I think editors who speak Spanish could be very helpful as many sources about Machado are written in Spanish I would propose adding the following on her work as an actress after the sentence about posing for Playboy based on chronology Machado was cast in the comedic soap opera Una familia con suerte where she played a woman who fell in love with her brother s enemy The show began airing in Mexico in February 2011 and in the United States in October of that same year The same source can also be used in an Early life section for the facts that she is originally from Maracay and is of Spanish and Cuban heritage,0
The problem I am having with reference 19 i e the Stockholm Museum is that I do not know how to classify it in terms of Wikipedia Primary Secondary and tertiary sources see Wikipedia No original research page When I go to the web page of the Stockholm Museum I cannot find the actual reference As far as I know the sources preferred by Wikipedia would be secondary sources attributable to scientists actual people working the field Books and science journal articles which review the state of the art contain lots of references discuss the work of others in the field and in turn their work is peer reviewed in proper scientific journals or by other books of similar nature would be the preferred sources The Seaby article about Viking stirrups is a good example of a science journal article Florin Curta works at the University of Florida he is a well respected historian and archeologist I do not know much about Eric Christiansen but his book The Norsemen etc does contain lots of references of other people s work I would think it would be necessary to contact the Stockholm museum and find out who the person is who makes this claim about the age of those Viking graves with stirrups and in what peer reviewed or reviewable publication this assertion was published,0

Deletion of my wiki,0
From witches to fairies to ball lightning there s no end to your thirst for weird phenomena is there I never thought you d be external link though whatever next Now what should we do about that popular culture section,0
Understood Personally I myself believe that any section which seeks to explicitly state that X is an official doctrine of the group as a whole might be misguided However that does not rule out the possibility that some stated beliefs might not be notable enough for inclusion whether they are necessarily universal or not One of the most obvious to me is the apparent exclusive use of the KJV which I have found in several sources That also at least potentially can lead to further apparent doctrines if the KJV in use contains imperative language regarding any given subject of the thou must or thou shalt variety as any group of the King James Only movement which seemingly this might be counted in would be more or less bound to such interpretations If there is a clear imperative in the King James and if there are outside reliable sources which indicate that belief in something based on that imperative is part of the CC then it could reasonably make sense to include it However I do think any and all such statements should be preceded by a statement to the effect of the church having no official doctrines which can be known by outsiders and that any claims of a more or less absolute nature regarding beliefs should take that into account I also regret to say that one article I found referring to overseers if accurate and I think we have to assume that it at least could be could imply that there is some sort of formal policy instruction for ministers of which non ministers would not necessarily be aware Right now I have only one reference to that idea that I ve found but there are additional sources out there and they might go further Based on that single source that has been found I can t say that there is reason to include it but more sources might add more information later And sadly regarding your personal history with the organization I hate to say that none of that can be used to influence content I have no doubt of the accuracy of what you have said but unless you ve been published somewhere your opinions and personal knowledge of any subject cannot be used on its own as a basis for determining content The same thing applies to me and any other editor out there,0
I don t think Gambetta s work is a reliable source for this specific matter He lists maha as a possible root in the appendix of his book he did not consider the etymology of mafia to be important to his study Gambetta does not speak Arabic and is not a linguist He cites a 1959 book by Novacco as his source who in turn cites an 1881 paper by a certain V Piola as his source I cannot find this paper anywhere on the Web With the utmost respect to Prof Gambetta this feels rather dubious and I think it would be wise to consult a linguist schooled in early Arabic I have already offered several links to online dictionaries that translate maha to oryx not cave It will be rather hard for me to find a book that explicitly says that maha never meant cave because this isn t a popular misconception I would really have to ask a linguist to give a professional opinion but I wonder if you would accept that,0

As a Wiktionary editor I feel the need to point out that if trek is regarded as a verb to trek into darkness must be a verb phrase not a noun phrase The phrase trek into darkness can only be a noun phrase if trek is regarded as a noun compare open the school verb phrase vs opening of the school noun phrase I would have thought Xkcdreader would have realised this when writing that Trek Into Darkness becomes the noun phrase because it describes a specific event The claim that star is an adjective is interesting I would have interpreted it as a noun used in a noun noun compound as is common in English compare field worker computer science but I see that some dictionaries do consider it an adjective I ve opened an inquiry on Wiktionary into whether or not it meets Wiktionary s Criteria for Inclusion as an adjective Regardless of whether star is an adjective or a noun the second element star trek star trek into darkness is a noun if star is a noun it is singular it will only be followed by trek rather than treks if the whole phrase is viewed as imploring a celestial body O star trek into darkness and be not afraid If star is an adjective a verb should only follow it if it is being substantivised and even then it needs a definite article to avoid sounding like Journalese poor have a hard time finding work A non substantivised adjective followed by a verb makes no sense red administer the school In the end star trek into darkness does seem to be a noun phrase like descent into hell but not for the reasons Xkcdreader claims,0

I made no personal attacks whatsoever I merely stated that what was being used in the article was not a reliable source and explained why it wasn t a reliable source so that no one thought I was removing it from the article because I simply didn t like what the source was saying If we want to say something like Branch Davidians have made claims that the compound was fired on by helicopters and cite a news article I m fine with that As you pointed out allegations have been made since 1995 about firing from helicopters However allegations of something occurring is not the same thing as evidence that it occurred So we can certainly include allegations by cult members but those allegations do not equal evidence that the helicopters fired on the building,0

I looked at what I could which was the wikipedia article about the chicago sun and to me it looks weak things like this make the tabloid appear less than reputable After a Sun Times article by Michael Sneed erroneously identified the perpetrator of the April 16 2007 Virginia Tech massacre as an unnamed Chinese national the People s Republic of China criticized the Chicago Sun Times for publishing what it called irresponsible reports The newspaper later silently withdrew the story without making any apologies or excuses and as the link is of little or no value to the article I request it be removed Is the article accessable on line and what information in the article is it actually supporting,0

If you don t mind me asking why is there need for a Criticism Section within this article if there is a full article elsewhere You say the POV of ex followers is over represented in this article Are you the only qualified judge of that I thought this was a collective effort to reach NPOV and that there was no one standing in judgement Please correct me if I m wrong I am not suggesting that any particular POV is represented I am trying to help editors from different POV s achieve an actual impartial fair article which has a NPOV Your comment makes me wonder if you are a little cynical about the practicality of this ideal I m not cynical and that is actually why I m here I hope you d agree that the best way to achieve the Wikki goal is to list facts and be rigorously fair in representing all POV s in a NPOV manner I also hope you re not suggesting that the Prem Rawat article is somehow the domain for the student s POV and that the Criticism full article is where all the other POV s go I thought that the spirit of Wikipedia was that ALL articles should strive rigourously to be impartial and that we could sort of beat out an impartial informative article by sticking to the Wikki guidelines I intend to learn and stick to the rules on reputable sources BTW I don t particluarly want my edits added to the Criticism Section I am primarily only interested on a few small changes to this article Thanks,0

48 hours is a bit much for a user reverting some random IP I m not sure what this block is going to achieve at this point Niteshift thought he was within his limits Niteshift would it be accurate to say that you are going to be more careful about the 3RR even with IPs and regardless of the exact time the edits are made People can be blocked for making less than 4 reverts since the point is to avoid edit warring I think you meant well and as long as you re more careful I don t see why anyone would oppose unblocking you,0
with respect Bluehotel i keep an eye on this page and get updates as soon as edits are made i reverted your previous unilateral addition of a See also section because you had for your own undisclosed reasons listed three organisations which are entirely unrelated to the subject of this article this was a meaningless and redundant edit this latest i reverted because the article already makes clear that most of the info you query comes from NKT IKBU sources this is clear throughout i feel if you check WP in fact accepts that articles on an institution or organisation may use its own publications as sources where appropriate as these are often the only sources available so long as doing so doesn t skew the article or misrepresent a subject it would be good to find 3PS for some of these points and if you d like to do so then that would be a valuable contribution i don t agree with you that all these points need a 3PS however and when i can find the time i ll review each more carefully to see which do and therefore without one a fact tag this isn t a private page and i wonder why you say that in fact it s the result of a lot of collaboration by many editors with many different viewpoints in the tradition of WP lastly if you feel that 1 100 centres and groups is hyperbole then you can check their published directory which gives the addresses and contact details etc although once again this is of course a SPS,0

No It s internationally recognized as part of Ukraine by international organizations such as the United Nations which even passed a vote condemning Russian annexation It s always possible to round up a couple countries to support you in international politics but that s not what determines recognition And who cares if a couple partially recognized territories pretty much all also Russian created phony states recognize Russian aggression And there s absolutely nothing in Wikipedia policies or guidelines that says we have to judge the language based on the number of speakers we go by what country the region belongs to Including Peninsulas of Russia as a cat is straight up irredentist aggressive territory marking and clearly in violation of WP NPOV Removing that cat is NPOV but not cramming it into here I guess if we had a category for Territories claimed by Russia or something like that that could go in And I don t care what the text was if it was in violation of Wikipedia policies then it gets changed That s how Wikipedia works,0

As I said in common parlance in other words simply pointing out that wound up is common terminology to describe such a situation I suppose it s similar to what happens to an unfortunate patient who may be on life support and found to be brain dead clinically dead but the family has the life support machine kept on for a further week when it is eventually switched off and the patient dies the death will be recorded as happening subsequent to the life support machine being switched off though we all know the patient was really dead at least a week earlier The old Rangers may not have had its life support switched off yet but for all practical purposes it became clinically dead in 2012 Regards,0

There is a process by which Wikipedia edits are resolved and that process begins with discussions on the Talk page of the article in question No serious previous discussion of the Synopsis section of this article has been held here other than the inane Woo Hoo I am only asking that we discuss the merits of the encyclopedic nature of the Synopsis on the Talk page You find that an attempt at humor Further the discussion above you point to is for another article Besides why hide a discussion of the merits of a section somewhere nobody knows to look when there is a Discussion tab on the article itself Anyway back to the merits of the disputed section It is an accurate synopsis written well without use of offending or extraneous or POV or any other qualities which might disqualify it as encyclopedic Thus far nobody has actually raised an actual reason the section is non encyclopedic other than basically because I say so or because it s funny Please provide some reason why this section should be removed Otherwise I will continue to support it s inclusion,0

Re the revert wars that don t seem to end There seems to be a constant and unconstructive continuation of these edit wars and so I think it is important to detail who is more accurate in their editing After this page was expanded I contacted the editor of Urban75 giving him the link for the page which at the time was the revision as of 21 00 31 May 2005 He agreed and accepted the accuracy of article as of that date save for a few minor personal details that he asked to be edited out The political nature of the site which seems to be the main point of disagreement for the page has been confirmed as left wing instead of liberal by the owener of the site Anything contradicting this can I think therefore be regarded to be inaccurate Anyone who disagrees with this please raise it here on the discussion page instead of resorting to vandalism on the main page Cheers I appreciate that you are new to the messageboard which is the topic of your quaint article Please state the exact words of the messageboard s owner when he declared it to be a left wing website unsigned comment by 81 156 210 59 9 43 19 June Apologies for my late reply First of all this being Wikipedia this is not my quaint article and it is ridiculous to say so Secondly the Editor s exact words were a brief Thanks for your efforts looks great before asking me to remove personal details Thirdly as I have said below there seems to be some confusion over the dispute perhaps the particular section which has suffered edit wars is not the messageboard section as many appear to have believed but the protest activism section of the website over which the Urban75 community do not have control of see below Revert wars again I don t think we re ever going to see a resolution to this problem Wikipedia s too good to have Urban trolls coming over and ruining it I m putting this article for VfD PS This is after I ve had the fake Ernestolynch and the IPs all stuck up on Wikipedia Vandalism in progress several times and my user and talk pages vandalised replaced with redirects to Pedophilia It s fucking me right off and I don t want the cunts from Urban75 over here as well This link between the two sites has to go Sorry With all due respect who are you to come in and comment on a topic you have no interest nor knowledge upon It is power crazy people like you that wikipedia was set up to by pass unsigned comment by 81 156 211 66 see Wikipedia Vandalism in progress I think it s a bit much for one of the perpetrators in the latest edit war to come in and complain about them and put the article up for VfD I m letting the VfD stand but I ll block if he edit wars again A small warning too I don t use the WP 3RR but Smiley s behavior is way beyond that and he s tripped my personal standard for disruptive editor He could be blocked for up to a month if he behaves especially badly More Edit Warring by Warofdreams It seems that a contributor who admits to having very limited knowledge of the messageboard the article refers to keeps reverting to an out dated and discredited article which casts a slur on users of the messageboard He claims to be a member of Urban75 called Tokyo although a quick survey of regulars revealed him to be an unknown and possibly trolling element Would the editors kindly warn this disruptive user Warofdreams about his petulant behaviour Thanks unsigned comment by 217 45 252 26 12 26 19 July 2005 There is a consensus for the accurate version of this article describing it as left wing and excluding the various other additions such as describing people as trolls which you have made It s nice to see you finally discussing your endless reverts to your version of the article if you could address the issues rather than slinging slurs at various users You also seem somewhat confused as to who the editors are We are all editors of Wikipedia Prove this idea that posters on Urban75 are left wing If you could seeing as you don t post there unsigned comment by 217 45 252 26 As you are in a minority of one you are going to have to demonstrate that it is liberal rather than left wing The large number of posters from socialist and anarchist groups and the tiny number who describe themselves as liberals regardless of what your opinion of them may be suggest to me that the consensus is correct This needs to be settled and I believe there may have been some confusion in the edit warring The specific section that has been so ferverently edited is the Protest and Activism section where it has been disputed as to what political affiliation it is This section of the article deals with the protest section of the main Urban75 website link and not the messageboards as seems to be the impression by some users Examples of such left wing articles found in the section here and here The messageboard section of the article does not mention any political leanings as yes liberals do post on the messageboard as well as communists anarchists socialists and even right wingers However to save any confusion in the future I have made a small change to the title of the section so there is no doubt as to what part of the article refers to the messageboard and what does not Hopefully this will slow down the reverting a little bit Naming the editor seems to have a problem with XX name and likeness being included on an entry about a site he created This is proposterous Apart from anything else XXs name and address can be easily discovered by doing a whois on urban75 com Wikipedia s accuracy should not be affected by a neutrotic webmaster s paranoia and sense of self importance I don t see why his name and in particular his picture have to be on here if he has requested they are removed While it doesn t place Wikipedia under any obligation to remove them removing them as a courtesy makes sense As an example we removed the article on Jimbo Wales when he requested it was taken down and only restored it when he relented I don t have a problem with it XX himself does and has specifically asked that any mention of his name be removed from the article which I respect Your vandalism trolling is becoming increasingly weary Ernestolynch Straw poll Let s see if we can finally settle this dispute with a straw poll Please register your vote as a signed in user Urban75 s online community is best described as left leaning Support Urban75 s online community is best described as liberal leaning Drop the adjective altogether from that sentence Ridiculous So a bunch of people who aren t potentially members of this English bulletin board are going to decide on whether the general current of thought is liberal in the English NOT American sense of the word or Communist ie Left leaning If you are so knowledgable about this bulletin board which gives you reason to keep trolling this article why don t you post up a poll on the bulletin board itself Do you have any interest in contributing to Wikipedia If so then you must follow the conventions laid down by consensus I couldn t care less what your definition of left is or who you regard as a troll I have been extremely patient and am following the standard procedures for dispute resolution If you are not interested in resolving disputes on Wikipedia I suggest you desist from editing articles on it Read Wikipedia No personal attacks before communicating with me again That s a no then You re not a registered member of the bulletin board to which the article refers you have scant knowledge of it yet you persist in this strange obsession with it Why As I have told you before I have used the bulletin board on occasion and have been a registered user for several years The content of Wikipedia articles needs to be decided by Wikipedia using the clear evidence of the overwhelming number of left wingers on Urban75 compared to self defined liberals Of course these are just one or two words which while they set the tone of the article are only a tiny portion of the whole However they rather represent the last bastion of your inaccurate version of the entire article We can perhaps look at your version of the Libcom article entirely POV which it appears you have now abandoned I ve tried getting a consensus which bar you we have I ve tried setting up a straw poll which you have ignored What do you suggest as a way forward In principle that is correct Wikipedia must follow Wikipedia s rules Whether people are or are not members of the BB have little bearing on what this article should say other than having some knowledge of the subject So are there any other areas of dispute or is the left liberal issue the only one Is there any objective evidence available to decide the issue We ll need more participation than the two of you to have a consensus Thanks for locking the page I hope it s given things time to cool down While there have been several issues over this page as can be seen from its history and this discussion the left liberal line is the only persistent issue remaining Perhaps the answer is to remove the words from the intro paragraph entirely and instead insert a discussion under Forum culture of the political tendencies of users of the site Protected Ok the revert war seemed to be getting nowhere I didn t see any way to tell what was the best version to protect since this war seems to have been from the beginning But it won t kill anyone to have the article not in their preferred state for a day or so Please work out a consensus here on what is the best label and policy for inclusion of other information and only then I or someone will unprotect the article If anyone would like to continue editing non disputed areas of the article please copy the article source to Urban75 temp and edit that Please ask for wider opinion in order to establish the best consensus possible I have no connection to the subject of the article and I know nothing about it and I will remain that way only here to decide when there is consensus and make sure the process is fairly administered Thanks and lets be productive instead of reverting I see no serious edit warring in the history Whole days go by without any editing As protection is generally regarded as a last resort I m taking the liberty of unprotecting LAME Two months of arguments over two words is rather depressing Urban75 now has a very well deserved spot on WP LAME More Trolling by Warofdreams Thenugga and Taxman When will these vandals desist Please read Wikipedia Vandalism and especially Wikipedia No original research The second one is a formal policy about the kinds of material not allowed in Wikipedia articles and what you keep adding back qualifies very clearly as original research Now if you continue to add the material back in clear violation of that policy then your edits do become vandalism and you can be blocked from editing for that We are not a discussion board and you don t get to write whatever you feel like nad keep putting it back in Original research Now that I think about it nearly the entire article is original research and needs to be either removed or cited to a source Original research includes anything that is the opinion or observation of the editor adding it that is not from an outside published source That sounds harsh but we need to follow Wikipedia policies here Again we are an encyclopedia not a discussion board Only material verifiable by outside source should be in the article So are there any sources to back up what is in here If something can t be verified by an outside source it should be removed I ve added a reference template to the article if I get the chance I ll list a few references Most can be found on the Urban75 site itself or direct links to certain posts threads on the message board Well do what you can but of course the site can t serve as a reference for this article except in very limited circumstances That s circular and what we re after is independent references If you re referring to using the site to find reference to articles written in the press about it that of course would be better Banned from Urban 75 I ve removed the following note from the page posted as a comment by WARNING TO URBAN75 USERS If you edit this article you risk being banned from urban75 I m unsure why this might be the case in any case I haven t been banned from the website but thought that the talk page was the best place to raise any issues Yeah it s pretty borderline even as an html comment For one thing there s the issue you raise of whether its true or not and there s also the point that we don t need to do the warning We don t care if people get banned from it it s not our site Let them warn and ban people if they want to Besides now it s on the talk page it doesn t need to be in the article edit text It s clearly true as a bit of research will show At least two users have been banned for editing this article and seeing as most of the edits on this page are by urban users I felt they ought to be warned that Eddie Tor thinks he rules wikipedia too Most people won t bother to read this talk page so a comment in the source is the only way to inform people You re taking it out of context any users who add inaccurate or malicous content as editor put it fuck about with the wikipedia article will be banned from Urban75 if identified Which roughly translates to If anyone disagrees with me or in fact fails to worship the ground I walk on it s banning time much the way urban is run in general Good argument for pseudonimity methinks BTW editing other people s comments is generaly considered bad form Seeing as the wikiuser calling himself thenugga aka a relatively new U75 poster called exleper and the wikiuser calling himself Warofdreams who refuses to identify which username he posts on U75 as have both put up inaccurate content on wikipedia especially in regard to Forum Culture one could easily be led to think that this was used to remove another poster who refuses to worship the Editor along with Anna Key Ace Hatboy Freethepeeps TopCat and so on all long term posters whose personalities didn t fall into line with the corporate media friendly brand image that is Urban75 an online curriculum vitae for the self proclaimed online anarchist guerrilla journalist sponsored by Sony By the way the poster calling himself ernestolynch on here is not the long term poster calling himself ernestolynch on Urban75 and who is now banned Just to clear things up for the gestapo ernestolynch It transpires with a little bit of research that the wikiuser called ernestolynch is not only someone impersonating the former U75 poster called ernestolynch but is one of the U75 posters long regarded as being an enemy of his Quite good work by this cyber bodysnatcher I didn t want to go here but let s be quite clear about this Whoever posted under the IP address 86 130 212 205 has been positively identified as being ernestolynch on U75 by cross referencing IPs and times of posting with that username There were warnings the warnings were bumped so that he would be aware of them as he was actually on another ban at the time of the original warning he ignored them while indicating that he was clearly aware of them by his edits and he has now been banned This isn t a Wikipedia issue I think Wikipedia has had enough boring U75 board politics by a long stretch I have no idea whether Ernestolynch here is the same person and neither does anyone else with access to IP data from Urban Which begs the question who is the impersonator A member of the management Loki Lock Light Belboid or Dubversion Strikes me as being very convenient indeed Ernestolynch s postings were entirely irrelevant to you getting banned which was all based on things done under your IP address And it s still not a Wikipedia issue I don t give a monkeys whether I m banned from Urban75 Sony It s been going downhill for ages Mister Mackay I just want to know who s been using ernestolynch on here Which begs the question who is the impersonator A member of the management Loki Lock Light Belboid or Dubversion Strikes me as being very convenient indeed Well it certainly wasn t me and I haven t pointed the finger My only edit was to remove a rather unpleasant slur against myself and i hate beckham Loki I now suspect that this phantom wikiuser called Ernestolynch is actually Captain Mainwaring himself Some convenient tastick ruse to make the former poster known as ernestolynch note lower case look like he gives a shit about being deported from his little Sony licious messageboard It s a well kept secret that many of the moderators post under alternative usernames on U75 to curb debate quell dissent and send threads bin ward See Mainwaring s own guide to creating online communities where the curmudgeonly bank manager states If your boards are proving as popular as a wet night in Aberdare you may have to pull a few strokes to liven things up Try registering under a host of different names and starting no holds barred argument with yourself on a host of controversial topics But you re playing for high stakes if people suss out that the community is in fact a collection of your argumentative alter egos they ll be gone forever Unless they are billy no mate blow ins to Brixton that is How dare you I know for a FACT that editor and fridge magnet DO NOT have other user names in which they post The fact that other people lose arguments against them IS THEIR FAULT not ours as any right thinking poster would no doubt agree with Run a poll we ll see who is right Critical sites The bannedfromurban site that is repeatedly added and removed is an incorrect representation of posters who have been banned from Urban75 we ve banned far more people than that by a factor of at least a hundred it s an advocacy site basically and I don t think has any value as information but what is the status of sites critical of the subject of an article Could some more experienced editor comment on this Penfold demands no criticism He is always right Perhaps he could shed light on this fake Ernestolynch Are you posting here under that name Y N How dare you criticise the hard working and under rated mods at urban Those bastards deserved banning and I d ban more in case they posted critical comments too Hear hear I m glad you are gone you big bully Flimsier Please someone run a poll to see that this sub ern troll is banned I don t want him banned but if people think so and agree with me that I AM THE NICER PERSON maybe maybe the moderators should do something It s time people like him were gone from urban Yes Poll Are there any effective remedies for MPD these days The above comment was meant in a light hearted manner and in no way should be taken in offence Urban75 takes the issues surrounding mental health and mental illness very seriously We also donate regularly from our funds to several mental health charities Thank you Mike Editing of this article A warning to all No further editing of this article by anyone other than myself or Fridgemagnet is permitted Further I require the person editing under the name of Warofdreams to identify their Urban75 username below to avoid causing me more hassle Sorry where did you get the authority to prohibit things on Wikipedia This is not the Urban75 Editor Err check PMs Fridge Also Kid Eternity William of Walworth R I C O and TeeJay are not the posters with those usernames on U75 though for non users I suppose they wouldn t mean anything anyway Yes I am R I C O Or I was anyway before I left that ghastly messageboard Nice try using the name of someone who s left But the real R I C O has already emailed mods to say that this isn t him No I haven t Why would I after none of you stuck up for me when the UKP P clique ganged up on me They Butchersapron past caring and LLETSA were stalking me and you did not ban them Please stop the lies fridgemagnet I d just like to inform everyone that the person posting on here under the name R I C O is nt actually R I C O from urban75 I never registered under that name I edit entries on Wikipedia under my real name R W My urban name was changed due to work reasons and I decided to leave urban75 after my workload increased substantially I don t even post like that either and I don t go round naming names that mean very little outside the context of the board So whoever you are get a life eh Are nt you supposed to be a teacher Pretty lame effort that whoever you are There s no R W in the wikipedia user namespace Quality trolling This is some pretty good trolling going on right here Sorry we ever brought Ernie along Your telling me somebody is posting in wikipedia under my former username Ive informed the editor of urban75 by the way and I will be asking them for an IP match so I can find out who it is I enjoyed posting on urban75 and I don t want someone posing as my old username dragging the site through the mud My authenticity as the real R I C O can be proved by both the editor and the rest of the mods I think its in their best interests to get this character banned from wikipedia R W 19th September 2005 Will you stop claiming to be me with these ludicrous unverified posts Where were you when the P P bullies were hounding me about that old racist Who are you What s P P I ve never used that term R W 19th September 2005 Once again I d like to inform all urban75 users that the person masquerading as R I C O is not actually R I C O from urban75 R W 19th September 2005 Well you are persistent I ll give you that Now who are you Butchersapron Past Caring Chuck Wilson LLETSA Wanker Why did you lie about posting under my real name And please stop putting my real name on the internet And you Tom what do you mean we brought Ernie along Is ernestocunt behind all this Have nt you got anything better to do with your time ern I know the banning from urban75 has hit you hard but there s no need to be bitter If you know me so much on what day was I born This is gonna make me laugh Ernestocunt You think I d really mess around with usernames in that utterly lame witless way You can do better than that And in any case when I do finally decide to go back to urban75 after finishing my caseload I d like to see you log in as R I C O because you don t know what the password is do ya Sucker Richard White 19th September 2005 Richard White R I C O Whichever one of you it is please tell me and others where your evidence is that Walter Chamberlain is a racist and was shouting racist slogans before he was beaten up by a gang of youths What s your evidence that he was nt Spirit of Vengeance God are you a goth or something Whoever you are and I have my ideas I ve left urban75 for pastures new so if you want to bring up topics discussed in that site with a non member this is nt the time or the place I don t have time for pedantic and patronising fuckwits like yourself who seem hell bent on following former users around as if its their only purpose in life I am no longer posting on urban75 and I wanted to inform the editor of the site that it was nt me pissing about with the wikipedia entry So fuck you Jesus this is so pathetic You d think that people would actually have better things to do with their time Like a job Richard White 20th September 2005 GETTING BORED WITH ALL THIS BOLLOCKS Very funny Ern Nice to see that he likes to cock around with people s messages too I have nothing against people on JSA I was on it myself for 4 months this year Good troll is nt he Richard White 20th September 2005 So you DID NOT write the words dole ite layabout Why are you trying to lie again You MUST BE the real Richard White then Why in the name of G D are you trying to misrepresent me here I have nothing against the unemployed types I have just been emailed by the mods at urban to warn me about this trolling I shall complain to the highest authorities you watch Forum Culture Would the user please use this discussion page before he inaccurately edits the section about Forum Culture Trolling by and Would the above users please use the discussion pages to justify their persistent editing of this article The position of the user called Fridgemagnet as a manager on the messageboard which this article is about does not entitle him to edit war this piece Similarly Warofdreams although he may be an expert on African countries and Trotskyite sects in England is vastly unaware of the topic he is obsessively editing For the benefit of other readers the original edits by 86 134 80 52 which have been reverted by myself and Warofdreams were unjustified in discussion untrue anyway apart from the one on Political correctness gone mad which I d accept and contained a whole load of irrelevancies designed simply to give the impression yet again that a certain tiny subset of banned posters were being unfairly treated I m not arguing with sockpuppets but if anyone else is interested I ll expand Note that is the latest sockpuppet of the user also responsible for and the other users created merely to constantly place irrelevant information into this article So Fridgemagnet you would be prepared to ask a general cross section of U75 posters and not just this conveniently anonymous Warofdreams and your usual line up of sycophants whether the following statements are true ernestolynch coined the rascist 3 rolleyes and a mad phrase he also coined a few others rorymac started the other and oddjob and rednblack the others Your dishonest rewriting of history in order to make you sound more interesting than the sort of person who takes pictures of his breakfast and puts it on his inane website is making you look like a right fool This is not ernestolynch by the way but someone who has posted for longer than you on u75 and cannot post these comments due to your current power crazed paranoia Ernestolynch here I ve just been emailed this latest bit of tomfoolery that the internerds seem to be up to I definitely started the Rascist catchphrase as well as the bangs on perspex screen Lord knows why that Fridgemagnet is acting all authoritarian on Wiki about it and lying to the Wiki editors Rorymac definitely started the shakes fist one and rednblack did the Bin ban etc mad expression As for the bookmarks well oddjob was banned for 24 hours for that as well as pissflaps Maybe Generalissimo Fridgemagnet would like to explain why he believes these to be untruths and back his paranoid claims with some evidence Love the trolling on here though glad to see the hell has been unleashed by the legions Edited to add a bit sick for Fridgemagnet to be using mental illness as a snide joke Amazing what he can get away with here maybe those alternative usernames he uses on Urban75 are so he can let off steam there Ern Furthermore Who the hell is this Warofdreams character It must be one of the UKP P trots but who would have a barnet like that Were his sidies burnt off while he was playing dungeons and dragons It must be Cockneyrebel Members to be banned from Urban75 once their identities are revealed In line with Captain Mainwaring and Penfold s decree that people who edit this article are to be banned for brand violation and misrepresentation of the party line here is a list of the fiends Thenugga aka exleper an U75 member since Nov 2004 Warofdreams aka Identity Unknown see below Smileyrepublic aka Unknown rumoured to be Chio R I C O goes by the same alias on U75 Ernestolynch not the U75 ernestolynch but rumoured to be an alias of errant U75 Moderator Fridgemagnet More later Identity of Warofdreams This wiki user has been involved in some catastrophic edit warring on this article Let s look at the evidence He claims to come from Sheffield although he most probably is some sort of perpetual student there He s definitely a Trotskyite and aged around 33 His clothes and hair suggest someone into role playing games such as Dungeons and Dragnons or something The evidence points to Belboid a Trot from Sheffield Cockneyrebel leader of the Workers Militia Rebel Warrior a bizarre Trot ladyboy naah WarofDreams is exactly who he says he is ern as you noted back in may or somesuch time and stop capitalising me old bean eh urban75 brand The article should probably contain information on the captain s protection of the urban75 brand and his clothing line produced in stirctly limited quantities to make it underground and exclusive Here is the captain s quote as the messageboard part of his site is not open to the public Well if there s enough interest a different version of the shirt could be sorted That way the original stays exclusive but others can sport a similar shirt with pride And I get some cash This is in reference to the Urban75 Baby Eating Anarchists t shirt which is another arrow in his corporate quiver Anarchism is made sexy and packaged for the masses to wear and the Internet Anarchist makes more cash to fund his shopping trips to New York,0
Hello nice to see new editors at Wikipedia What do you feel is wrong with the Monkey baiting article Thank you The quoted description of two fights and the discussion of the fighting styles of monkeys is not relevant The history of monkey baiting and the current status of such are There is lots of the first and none of the second The article reads less like an article on monkey baiting and more like a description of monkey baiting fights It was worse before my minor edit Monkey baiting is a rarely discussed topic in any books or websites see here therefore the maximum information that can be brought forward which provide citations knowledge and understanding of what this topic is about would be considered relevant to the article May I enquire what books magazines or other sources you are using to support your requested edits Cordially,0

Jim It is most tempting to simply deleted everything you enter rather than drudge through the references to see if they actually say what you claim they are saying The last section I removed started right off with Palin s outburst angered some because far from creating panels to decide about treatments these documents actually However Palin is not even mentioned in the reference you listed not to mention that you use that statement as a strawman argument against her Another section claimed that and analysts who examined the provision she cited 66 But that cite says nothing about analysts examining the provision Would you PLEASE stop inserting your own interpretation into these sections It calls into question every single edit you make,0

You fucking racist idiot the very fact that it was only 100bn and that had been for so long delayed and that such a huge new loan s was given under such conditions is the very point of it being extremely negative for the interests of Greek people tipping the scale greatly for the interests of the creditors even that is if one limits oneself to a framework of a supposedly a so called mutually agreed upon amicable agreement and exclude a Grexit etc Has for example the Greek debt become sustainable after and because of the program Fuck no It s even worse It s e g more or less the same in absolute terms and has skyrocketed in relative ones Moreover it has been issued under English British Law instead of Greek Law and is owed to the Official Sector instead of the Private one making a much needed and agreed upon once a primary surplus had been achieved a taken back promise and agreement substantial additional haircut or even an outright default even more harmful and or difficult to for Greece Have the consecutive DSAs and assumptions thereof etc been reasonable or even sincere Fuck no Even the supposedly achievable end result of the program s would be e g a debt level equal to the one Greece entered the crisis with in the first place And so on and so forth Note the interests of the European taxpayers have indeed been sacrificed be they Greeks only if one refers to them only cause Greek taxpayers belong to the set of the European taxpayers or Greeks and Germans and cause among things European EZ taxpayers in general have been lending Greece more and more again and again money to pay and save the German and French and Greek and banks etc kicking the can of the Greek insolvency further down the road and making thus things worse Note I won t even bother to comment on the Greek entry into the EZ There are plenty of arguments facts and citations available at the relevant section you have to deal with and argue against if you could Even if common sense sided with you which it doesn t it very often sucks in economics especially during macroeconomic crises watching someone supposedly teaching ex cathedra others economics by invoking common sense is very commonly guaranteed to be ludicrous The numbers the conditions for example you ve stated are not necessarily unsustainable by themselves for a country nor do they necessarily require the changes you re alluding to they re missing for example the context of the debt being mostly external for all practical purposes in a foreign currency because of the monetary union and that they ve followed a global crisis which caused a sudden stop to the capital inflows to this country and to other countries of said monetary union capital flows and stops flights in a very flawed monetary union that have in fact been regarded by many scholars economists analysts as the very cause of the problem crisis itself in the first place That means that even if common sense dictates something true it does not follow that it dictates what you re claiming it does Greece for example could have unilaterally defaulted and exited the EZ and then dealt with a different set of consequences and problems Or Germany and the rest of the surplus North could have reflated or differentially inflated in relation with respect to the South Periphery making the adjustment or the austerity needed demanded from or rather dictated to Greece and the rest of the South Periphery much softer much milder Or the austerity dictated on Greece could have been much less or much more frontloaded Or the ECB could have dropped the rates to zero from the start and kept them constanly there since or it could have gone for an OMT program from the beginning including or excluding Greece to from it Or the IMF could have relentlessly disagreed with the rest of what then became the Troika instead of acceding to their views against its own rules and hence never taken part in such a ridiculous program a mind boggling mess And so on and so forth The relevant decision tree or game has thus many more branches nodes paths etc the possible worlds the alternative possibilities are virtually endless compared to the specific and supposedly necessary story and sequence of events you re advocating The very reason I ve been arguing for a proper context and or against a simplistic and misleading definitive bullet list or summary of causes etc or against which I have to remind you cause for some strange reason it seems that you ve forgotten others have argued too is exactly because Wikipedia is supposed to present a NPOV to present the scientific scholarly etc consensus view or as many views as possible if there is no consensus on the subject at hand I ve cited and quoted e g at least one such respectable source that argues that Greek interests have been sacrificed in favour of the ones of the creditors That means that this has to be included or at least taken into account If other such sources disagree on this or even claim that e g it was not the Greek but rather the German or the Danish or the Martian interests that have been sacrificed or that that s fine let them be included or taken into account too as some of them for that matter presently are and have been and as and about which for example I ve have congratulated and thanked Danish Expert inspite of that is my slightly different view on the subject There are many POVs in such a complex multifaceted and long lasting issue that s what I ve been saying from the beginning So what I can t allow you to do be it as an interested Greek or as a thoughtful wikipedian what YOU MAY NOT do you ignorant and racist piece of shit is to have the article portay a single false or one sided supposedly definitive and simplistic picture of the crisis as the scientific consensus as a scientific fact Now I have spent more than enough time dealing with you feel free to fuck off PS Preemptively to any wikipedia admin s who might read this Punish me if you must for my language I don t care I don t mind in fact I understand and accept the consequences of my choice of words What I do strongly care about what I do strongly demand from you though is 1 to see and acknowledge the racist slurs this editor has used against me and more importantly against Greek editors and Greeks in general and to act on them 2 not to delete this discussion or any choice of words expressions used herein so that people interested readers or editors could judge for themselves and 3 to prevent this or any other editor from turning this article arguably even more into a simple minded POV article greatly misleading and misinforming or should I say disinforming readers who might come here to educate themselves on the subject,1

Well it seems you are right about Yiftachel then But I still contend that he is wrong If you read the statements of Israeli leaders then and now they never mention prevention of the return of refugees as a motive for Judaization They always say they are trying to create a Jewish majority and to block Arabs from expanding their villages to state owned land In other words the policies were aimed specifically to discriminate against the Arabs who remained within Israel s borders And incidentally if you read Zakour s remarks here you will see that he says the same thing He laments the fact that the public debate is always about the refugees and the West Bank and those Palestinians who stayed behind and suffered from the Judaization policies are forgotten It s not so much an error as a matter of emphasis we need to emphasize that the true target of Judaization is the indigenous Arab population,0
Sorry I didn t realize we had two Epic Geniuses at Wikipedia It displays like this Epicgenius talk contribs As for the station name in the Infobox it really is redundant The image would only need to be labeled if it wasn t the station the page is on Like to create an example one of Madison Square Garden sitting atop current Penn Station As pointed out the name is in the article title it s in bold in the 1st three words there s an extensive explanatory note as to the article and structure s proper name and a caption identifying the image as unambiguously being inside the Terminal Consistency is only synonymous with slavishness if someone makes it so See Metro North Railroad page as an example As well as here at GCT There is utterly no need for the name At the least it should be as plain and unobtrusive as these examples readily culled from the top of the list of union stations perused in the past Indianapolis Union Station 1850 New London Union Station 1887 Hartford Union Station 1889 Would you like to make a similar adjustment to the Infobox display or shall I Yours,0

Reply from Dawson Church Hi I ll respond point by point Please feel free to post 1 Firstly I hope you had Church s permission to reproduce personal correspondence I ll assume you did Secondly since Church starts his email with a personal attack on me I ll answer his charges 1 I ve ignored 3 4 of the research on EFT Care to provide citations that corroborate this and adhere to WP MEDRS I m sure that myself and the other editors here can integrate them into the article Yes if he clicks on the research page on emofree com the abstracts and in some cases where copyright permits the whole papers are there 2 Disparaging remarks about JCCP The journal Counseling and Clinical Psychology is not listed in Thomson s Journal Citation Reports neither is its succesor Psychology Journal Neither is listed on PubMed I cannot find any back issues online or in my University Library which has a pretty complete collection of Psychology journals If pointing this out is derogatory then I m afraid I can t help you It requires nothing more than a click on the j s home page 3 The funding issue and where pro EFT papers are published reflects a double standard I m afraid extraordinary claims require extraordinary proofs and higher than normal standards perhaps The pro EFT author funding body journal triangle does not inspire confidence on my part Has any research into EFT been funded by a neutral body like the ESRC or NIH Has any research with a pro EFT conclusion made it into a journal that doesn t specialise in and in some cases promote alt med Yes but you have to READ the research to find this out An author qualified to write a Wikipedia article will do so 4 Non discussion of results Actually I made many edits to this article previously attempting to discuss the findings of these papers because I believe they speak for themselves in that they are unimpressive underwhelming or outright discrediting of EFT Other editors felt that the article was providing undue weight to flakey research and the detail of the studies was removed Tough gig It is odd to refer to a statistically significant result as unimpressive It is unusual to refer to a randomized controlled design or a within subjects time series trial as unimpressive It is odd to be unimpressed by research that makes it all the way through the peer review process which is brutal These oddities make me wonder if this commentator has actually gone through peer review to get even a single paper published Researchers and responsible commentators such as science journalists carefully note the degree of statistical significance the experimental design the limitations and the results obtained An unbiased rewrite of the article will do the same 5 Journalistic sources You have a point But these are freely available widely read sources of information on a fringe topic so I d recommend they stay The Wikipedia article would benefit from a properly written critical section on the problems in energy psychology research Good ones are to be found in several peer reviewed sources Feinstein s paper in the the APA journal Psychotherapy in 2008 also his Controversies in Energy Psychology paper in EP journal in 2009 and Baker Carrington and Putilin s 2008 paper in Psychology J It is through thoughtful informed criticism such as this that the field advances 6 CONSPIRACY This is your most outrageous point Wikipedia is not mean and nasty to alt med topics because it is run by a secret cabal of anti CAM pro Pharma editors It has high standards because it is edited and editable BY EVERYBODY Fringe viewpoints and dodgy research do not fare well in such an environment No one is appointed to write ANYTHING Stop crying wolf Then I recommend that a writer with in depth academic clinical and research experience of EFT write the article Feinstein Gallo and Baker are all well qualified as you will see from their papers in peer reviewed publications 7 I m thick That s basically what you re saying isn t it Well I ve demolished the previous 6 points so I think I m equipped with the the intellectual tools to respond to YOUR personal attacks on ME 8 WP is so biased universities use it to teach students to spot bias Interesting I work in a university and I don t know anyone who does this Anyway how does that relate to EFT being anything other than total pseudoscience and magical thinking Stop attacking WP because you can t defend your viewpoint succesfully in this environment 9 WP articles should have a neutral POV True And this one does Good thing eh Famousdog talk Take a look at the entries for other therapies such as Gestalt Therapy Psychodrama Behavior Therapy etc and you quickly note the difference between a well written and objective article and a biased and ill informed one I respond to many requests from clinicians and researchers for information about EFT every month This week it was a UNICEF doctor in Kosovo and then a Canadian colonel who commands a peacekeeping contingent They read my study in the Dec issue of Traumatology They were of course unable to get any useful information from Wikipedia So they emailed me for that information Wikipedia could perform a real public service by providing an article on EFT written to the same standards as those for other therapeutic approaches Dawson Posted by,0

There are many places where redlinks occur in wikipedia and they serve to prompt people to fill in the gap with more information Nor does deleting them improve the quality of information the bogus article on the Purdue society had a very full entry of its own That didn t make it true information You can t enforce rules if you do not understand how those rules are supposed to work,0
Also looking at your contribution history you make a lot of effort to add links to the Adult Film Database profiles of pornstars so what is your stance on the fact that Teagan s profile on AFDB contains 28 affiliate spam links to galleries that earn them money and each DVD listed in her profile has 4 6 links to DVD and VOD sites You seem to have no issue with the fact the Adult Film Database does exactly the same In fact you actively modify stars profiles to link to AFDB despite the fact AFDB contains approximately 330 spam affiliate links with Teagan s profile alone on the basis each DVD in her profile on the site contains an average of 4 links per DVD page Are you keen to remove all links to AFDB as well,0

Your second point the quotation is correctly cited and nothing has been lost so I m not certain what your point is Your first point if you d read the FAC and its talk page you d have understood why the citation no longer exists I have to say a simple what happened to these two citations would have sufficed rather than the post you ve made which I view as quite unhelpful The majority of the citations and the text pre copyedit in this article exist only because I bothered to spend some money read every single one of over 500 pages of source material and spend a good 20 30 hours of my time improving this article But obviously two citations are more important than that,0

I do understand that the Patterson Gimlin film is still in dispute to this day I saw a Bigfoot back in June of 1991 and that kind of opened the door to me to the whole Bigfoot phenomena When I was a small child I saw the film and was scared of it After my sighting I watched the Patterson Gimlin film several dozen times and I concluded Bigfoot I saw that day in 1991 looked VERY CLOSE to the creature in the Patterson Gimlin film The creature in the film was just under 7 and was a female due to the fact that it had breasts The one I saw was about 8 and a male I believe In the last few years the film has undergone digital analysis and examination and those that did the analysis COULD NOT determine that the film was faked Bigfoot researcher John Green back in 1967 shortly after the film was made went back to the site and filmed a stand in model Jim McClarin walking the same path that the creature took as a reference to determine the height and weight of the creature in the film The two films were superimposed to show the difference between the two McClarin stood 6 5 The creature in the film was taller and much more bulkier The arms on the creature are longer than a normal man s arms I recently viewed the film digitally enhanced at a meeting of the International Bigfoot Society I could see the muscles moving underneath the hair of the creature The creature walks with an unusual bent knee gait that is almost impossible to imitate The late Dr Grover Krantz tried once to imitate it but was unsuccessful Several anatomists have recently discovered some sort of injury on the creature s knee as it flexes its knee when it s walking I can see no seams on the creature that would indicate a costume Apes have a natural hair seam running down the length of their spines As to the feet in the film the area that the creature walked in the film was on sand and very soft soil which stuck to the creature s feet as it would to any animal or human for that matter that would be walking in soil like that with bare feet When the creature turns to look at the camera it just doesn t move its head it moves its entire upper torso in the direction of the cameraman just as an ape would do The creature turned to look at the camera because Bob Gimlin had crossed the creek and trained his rifle on it after Patterson told him to cover him in case the creature was agressive That s why the creature turned to look at the camera If this creature was a man in a costume why would he risk his life with Gimlin having a loaded rifle aimed at him That doesn t make sense Patterson ran out of film because the rest of the film in his camera had been used filming scenery for a documentary he wanted to do Before he could change the film in his rented camera the creature had disappeared into the woods Patterson and Gimlin did trail it but couldn t go any further because the creature s trail went into the mountains and they couldn t follow with their horses and they weren t logistically equipped to go up the mountain after the creature The film is shaky because Patterson was running after the creature while he was filming it and finally stabilized himself on a tree stump Patterson did not know anything about cameras or film speeds I have personally met Bob Gimlin and heard what he had to say about what Patterson filmed that day He sticks to his story that what he saw that day was a flesh and blood creature and not some guy in a fur suit Gimlin never made any money whatsoever on the film I am not trying to say that what everyone else believes is wrong I m just saying what I know about the film and I believe it to be authentic This was suppossed to have been faked by an ex rodeo cowboy Hardly Darin UTC,0

Taken from my post here First you sought to remove a suggestion i made on Event of Mubahala talk page here now you seek to undo my fact checking edit on the actual article s page using a false excuse You said in the edit summary It says or they emphasize more Well sir that is clear misrepresentation of the actual quote which says while the above rituals are celebrated by sunnis and twelve imam shiis there are others that are celebrated exclusively by the shia or that they emphasize more than the sunnis these holidays include the birth and death anniversaries of muhammad his daughter fatima and the twelve imams or sacred leaders of shiism The shia also celebrate other significant occurrences such as muhammad s public declaration of ali as successor at ghadir khumm near mecca during the prophet s final pilgrimage the meeting between muhammad his family and the christians from najraan at mubahila and It is clear that mubahala is seperated from sunni observance I can understand if shia desire to deceptively paint an exclusively shia practice as somehow having wider islamic currency and legitimacy just don t try repeatedly to fool someone that has more than one brain cell,0

The major distinction is between general and subject specific encyclopedias Robert Collison Andrew Brown and Tom McArthur s books are the first that come to mind which make that distinction The sections in this article are general and then specific is broken up into many sub groups that comprise the rest of the sections Some of them are well known categories in their own right but others look to be grouped according to some typical subject groupings The issue here is that you re creating a section outside of that scope based distinction The scope of Metapedia is broad it s just written from a perspective that colors the content,0

3 04 05 I wrote on Talk Republic I made the republican page a disambig instead of a redirect Is this OK as well from US viewpoint as from British etc viewpoint Not having received an answer to the question but confronted with two consecutive vandalistic reverts of the Republican page I move this discussion over here The last time I worked on the republican page was after the Belgian Flemish VRT television chain had broadcast an interview with the McCartney sisters where these women used the term republican not in any way referring to a form of government which is the topic of the republic page So an automatic redirect to the republic page is out of the question for the republican page as the thing has to be disambiguated As the term republican as they used it did not refer to any republic as such either the republic disambiguation is not suitable either They used it simply referring to the Irish Republican Army the Provisional flavour of the IRA in particular as a paramilitary group including probably its unestablished alleged links to Sinn F in but as these links are all but in the open they did not refer to the political party aspect at all exclusively to the aspects outside the official state organisation I ll re establish the republican article as I last left it and add a clarifying reference to justify disambig instead of redirect and I expect discussion here for avoidance of further vandalism,0

I hate to bring you the news but your contributions do this article little good For example the line Serbs started to settling in this region in large number from the 14th century onward contains no less than 3 grammatical errors You put word Hungary in many places where it was not necessary to mention it Not necessary or unwanted from a Serb point of view It is true that Hungary ruled over it because original inhabitants of this region were Slavs Bulgarians and Vlachs So what That happened all the time This argument has zero relevance especially if you consider that we are discussing the era of the great migrations Besides if you look at it now Slavs were also relative newcomers which makes your argument even more ridiculous who fought against Hungarian occupation You just say this but don t know it Or come up with some sources The border of proof is on you and I ask you not to revert this section Hungary enslaved them and ruled over their land So it was not integral part of Hungary but it was more a colony Same here Don t just make wild claims but back them up BTW if the Slavs had such a terrible time in Hungary how come the Slavic Serbs came to Hungary in such large numbers Again burden of proof don t revert unless backed by facts It was not true Again easy to say The migration of the a large Serb population is very relevant to the history of Vojvodina I gave one and you simply deny without even giving an alternative view That makes the article incomplete This is what RADOS LJUSIC says in The History of Serbian Culture featured on the website of the Serb unity Congress The Turkish conquest of the Balkans and Danube basin were preceded and followed by migrations of the Serbian people As the Turks penetrated into the land the Serbs withdrew The Serbs migrated ahead of the invading Turks because they did not want to live under the Turkish rule and they sought protection in the neighbouring Christian states who welcomed them to settle along the deserted borderlands and the Serbs participated in their wars It was not separated from Hungary It was a part of Hungary before the Turkish occupation Even you don t deny this Yet after the Turkish conquest when Hungary was admninistrativelyb restored even if ruled by Vienna certain parts like the military frontier Banat Transylvania were not ruled from Budapest but directly from Vienna How do you call this if not seperated It reintegrated into Hungary is more political then historical statement Vojvodina only was occupied by Hungary not part of it Yet you say After World War II Vojvodina was restored as a province of Serbia but of course that s a neutral remark right Sorry pal but you re measuring with double standards Because it creates a false impression that Vojvodina existed with present day borders in 1920 which is not true It was ethnic breakdown of non existing territory You speak about Vojvodina even in a medieval context but of course only when it suits you But of course the fact that only 1 3 of the population at the time was Serb is anti Serb propaganda right You do not expect from me to accept all do you I expect you to accept them if they are backed by facts and reliable sources So far yo keep reverting but haven t named one reliable source yet,0

Sorry wrong on all counts Page 40 of Kierner s book concerns Grace Sherwood c 1660 c 1740 The Virginia Witch It does not address the armament of Opecancanough in 1644 twenty years before her birth nor the French and Indian War alliances fifteen years after her death haha what all the modern reliable sources say are there no sources to support your point of view at all It may be we can help you here with chronology as sequence of events matters in historiography Page 217 of Gallay s book Indian Slavery concerns Indian slavery in Southeastern Indian and British Societies 1670 1730 which does not address either Opencancanough s armament in the assault of 1644 nor the French and Indian War under discussion The Westos traded with Virginia colonists exchanging war captives for guns and terrorizing Indians throughout the southeast with their slave raids not attacking British colonists with firearms as Opecancanough did In the early 1660s the Westos moved out of the region of Virginia into the Carolinas almost a hundred years prior to the French and Indian war under discussion 1754 1763 page 41 of Gallay s The Indian Slave Trade The Rise of the English Empire in the American South is about Carolina the Westo and the Trade in Indian Slaves 1670 1685 not in Virginia and after the French and Indian War Bowne s The Westo Indians Slave Traders of the Early Colonial South notes At the height of their influence between 1659 and 1680 it is believed the Westos captured and sold several thousand Indians from Spanish Florida often trading them for guns The Westos were effective fighters until Native Americans banded together in confederacies and obtained their own fire arms from friendly Europeans to resist them The Westos did not arm Native American tribes to assault the colonists This does not reflect on how Powhatans gained firearms between 1622 and 1644 It is also irrelevant to a narrative concerning Native American alliances with the French against the English colonies in the French and Indian War That is you still have no sources to support removing the contested passage on most Native American tribes on Virginia s frontier joined with the French in a military alliance during the French and Indian War Seven Year s War,0

Firstly it is not known with any certainty if there really is a connection between the Sea Peoples and the Philstines all that is known is that one group of Sea People the P r s t in Egyptian has a name resembling Hebrew P lishti for Philistine Egyptian didn t have an l sound distinct from r The earliest Philistines are called Avvites in the Bible which says also that they were conquered by newcomers from Caphtor Traditionally Caphtor was understood to be Damietta in Egypt although there are other suggestions about where it was including Crete Cyprus Asia Minor nothing can be said with certainty The Philistines gradually assimilated into the Israelites having disappeared as a distinct group already in the Persian period with the last pagans descended from them being converted to Judaism under the Hasmoneans The Jebusites were conquered by the Israelites and together with the remnants of other conquered Canaanite people became part of the Jewish class known as the Nethinim having a specific religious role of caring for the Temple but who are no longer mentioned as a separate class already at the time of the Maccabees possibly having all been killed by the Seleucids Clearly no direct connection to modern Palestinians who are separated from them by literally thousands of years of history 7 July 2005 13 18 UTC,0

I ve suggested the anomalous wiki link be merged here and perhaps in some other overlapping articles Comment The article is in almost the same state it was 18 months ago when Klingoncowboy4 originally split it from Opera Whether it is merged or expanded is perhaps not the main point in practice sections which just duplicate the other articles should be deleted We use links to connect information on WP IMO we shouldn t repeat whole paragraphs of information from one article to another e g the Dafne sections There is a WP policy on this wiki link Having said that obviously if someone was willing to do a thoroughgoing article about the origins of opera that would be great Best,0

I have a problem with this paragraph The other two major genetic flow patters that can be seen from the R1a1 distribution are of the Slavic migrations from north eastern Europe to the Balkans as well as a distribution along the western coast of Europe and the British Isles which is believed to be connected to the Vikings There s also a lot of R1a1 in non coastal continental Western Europe Germany France and even Iberia and Italy in proportions not very distant from those of Britain This could have arrived with Celtic and maybe Germanic migrations along with some I Notice that Denmark is quite low in R1a1 so for the Vikings basically Danes to have caused such alteration in Britain they would have needed to replace all the population literally Also the claim is not sourced At this point all that can be said about R1a1 in Europe is that its diffusion seems linked to IE migrations The resolution of the studies is not good enough to give a better picture so far says The range of the distribution of R1a1 across Eurasia can be seen as the light blue colored group in the map on the third page of Wells Eurasian Heartland paper If Wells theory is correct the R1a1 haplogroup may have ridden on horseback from one end of Eurasia to the other So the association of this haplogroup with the Vikings is in truth little more than a minor footnote in the history of the R1a1 group I think I m deleting the whole paragraph too for the sake of encyclopedism,0

OpinionPerson Dear OpinionPerson I am astonished at the bias apparent in the Wikipedia article For a start it simply ignores about 3 4 of the research on EFT presented or published which is freely available by checking the research page on and other places This editor has posted a derogatory comment about a journal for which he apparently has the time while apparently not having the time to spend the two minutes it takes to verify that Counseling and Clinical Psychology changed its name to Psychology Journal about 2 years ago and continues under the same distinguished editorial board The editor notes that the Wells study was funded by ACEP and that other studies are published by integrative medicine journals implying that these facts render the studies suspect This is a double standard Wikipedia does not describe the funders or journal themes of other treatments see for example the entries on chemotherapy or cognitive behavioral therapy there are many other examples What the editors do not do is discuss the actual results of the EFT studies The sources Wikipedia does cite are critical articles in the Guardian and Skeptical Enquirer Neither of these are peer reviewed scholarly publications and both articles are very out of date Wikipedia for some reason seems to have appointed someone to write this and many of the other CAM entries who has no clinical background in the methods being described and limited interest or ability in reading understanding and reporting on research Even odder they seem to have picked a hostile and biased critic rather like asking the Pope to write the article on abortion I am reminded of Nicholas Taleb s comment in The Black Swan that such critics are paying you the ultimate compliment Without the intellectual tools to discuss your research which would make a genuine contribution to improving the field they instead attack peripheral issues While many of the articles in Wikipedia are fair and accurate I particularly admire the history and hard science articles articles like the EFT one have led to Wikipedia being used in some university courses as required reading for students in order to teach them to spot bias and inaccuracy Wikipedia has a stated goal of having the articles reflect a neutral point of view and I hope that at some point they clean up the EFT article and the other CAM articles to reflect this goal All the best Dawson Church PhD Posted by,0

Nonsense Without the name that is on this article this is simply another jejune article on one of life s less interesting topics With this name this article is a claim that me my family and everybody I know in Ireland is British That my friends is a myth of the most British imperialist proportions That dear people is your British nationalism working very very hard at imposing identities on another people my people So not to put too fine a point on it my lovely British nationalist and WASP friends go fuck yourselves Thank you very much,1

This malaysianews article generally claims that Uruguay had recognized the Palestinian State I assume that this refers to the SoP as declared in 1988 but it is not explicitly clear from the source itself Parts of the source that are inconclusive relationship with the Palestinian government and has indicated it will be represented at a mission in Ramallah this means PNA relations Missions in Ramallah are not embassies to SoP president Mujica s announcement only made official what was signed last April by the Foreign Affairs ministers from Uruguay and the Palestinian Authority to formalise existing friendly relations between both sides again PNA relations no SoP reference So the strongest almost SoP reference is President Jose Mujica confirmed that Uruguay had recognized the Palestinian State and said bilateral relations were now in place but unfortunately it is not a direct quote of Mujica words but an interpretation by the malaysianews writer A press release from Uruguay will be better especially if it includes direct quote of Mujica words and or link to the official documents signed We need a source showing that Uruguay recognizes the State of Palestine in contrast to Uruguay having relations with Palestinian Authority government and recognizing Palestinian state right to exist,0

Okay truthfully I am very getting upset by your behaviour such as wiki link As I ve said do the research before getting yourself involved was trolling my talk page repeatedly even after I told him that external link For no reason he then blanked a reply of mine to twice see external link and external link just to be disruptive I warned him for it and then he removed the warnings and further external link I didn t care that much at the time Out of the blue Wrestlinglover420 came along and posted external link to A Link to the Past which I saw as bad faith since he put himself in a predicament he knew nothing of Enough talking about this Chris unless it is of major importance then let me know of it and please please please please read your talk page What s the point of talking to me if you won t see my affairs You really upset me with this and if you continue to not pay attention to me then not to be wiki link I don t see why I should bother Simple,0

reposted from my talk page You ve mentioned several sites above but no links to actal articles Searching for Star Wars Revisted on WebProNews returned no results though same for Techdirt webnewssite which is a blog BTW and MediaPost search results link doesn t work Obviously the subject is important to you but just because it s notable to you doesn t necessarily confer notability to the world at large At one point you ve claimed that Star Wars Revisited has gained as much if not more notoriety as the cited Phantom Edit however that doesn t seem to be the case as I can quickly find stories on The Phantom Edit in Salon TheForce net National Public Radio the BBC NewsAskew The LA Times Entertainment Weekly Entertainment Weekly again The New York Times Guardian UK Chicago Tribune The Washington Post and there s more but I think you get the picture there just simply isn t the same level of coverage out there for Star Wars Revisited as there has been for the listed projects There s barely any coverage in reliable third party sources,0

Though I disagree with the idea of deleting this page I side with Mark on this this page is a complete nonsense A mixture of everything based on a debatable notion of classic metal While I originally expected to find a article dedicated to original heavy metal I realize this is actually not the case here there s indeed a complete confusion between several genres most particularly between hard rock original heavy metal and glam metal This article is not serious I suggest this article to be completely redone focusing exclusively on original heavy metal bands just like the german and french versions of this article did I have serious sources for doing so if needed Think of it like the term Classic Rock The Beatles and Dire Straits don t really sound the same but they re both called Classic Rock Zazaban I m sorry but this argument sounds like a personnal theory of yours Original research and POV First does anyone have any reliable sources about the existence of the very term classic metal I mean authoritative source that testifies the use of the term as A REAL GENRE not just as an informal word used by a few people Second any sources that testify that mixture Frankely speaking I never heard the term classic metal used as an official term As far as I know when we refer to original 70s 80s bands we just employ the terms hard rock or heavy metal in a restricted sense as opposed to broader meaning heavy metal Metal I have searched in my music encyclopedia and in the metal encyclopedia and there is no mention of a style called classic metal,0

I don t disagree with you my concern is that a long etymology of Ararat is out of place in an encyclopedic article about the mountain itself Unfortunately I doubt a standalone article the etymology of the word Ararat would meet the notability requirement though I could easily be mistaken in that opinion As a side note I see that the article was semi protected so a registered user changed it back to the previous version can we please use the talk page rather than vandalizing the article,0

Shavua Tov Shirahadasha To me the very heart and soul of Judaism is a focus on inwardness as the true essential person Recognition by others or public roles is only important in the sense that it could lead to inner growth Imagine a person who is truly spiritual a person with a pure nature who receives no recognition at all and quietly conducts their inner symphony to a G dly tune that only they can hear This nature this personality is the Jewish woman From this outlook Devorah was indeed a niviah but all her spiritual growth all her greatness and closeness to G d which were the precursors to her being chosen as the leader were certainly in her private and inner life It is only men who are driven by other things who require the outward Mitzvot and the external public roles to attain their spiritual perfection shykee,0
Oppose on several grounds First it doesn t actually have any of the usual political goals of well any part of the spectrum It s anti fascist and except for fascists themselves people of any political ideology can be anti fascist I m not sure we should even call it a political movement but this RfC isn t about that and I don t want to push that here Sources use a number of terms to describe it and some make it clear that it doesn t have political goals and includes people of varying political outlooks And they are real people we shouldn t label them all as far left,0
I realize they had to separate the disloyal from the loyal but it seems like six months is a long time to keep someone in custody without reasonable suspicion It s not just the six months though all in all it took something like 18 months total mar 42 to aug 43 to determine her loyalty Yeah it was wartime and I m sure the government had other things to do but it just doesn t pass the free to leave smell test To use an overused analogy to capture guys on a battlefield in Afghanistan is one thing but gathering all US citizens of Afghani origin and putting them in camps for 18 months while investigating loyalty would be another BTW The graph you cite shows camp population not the number of requests to leave,0
Thanks That s effectively what Hunter is arguing against that Spinoza has been interpreted as arguing against the existence of miracles but Hunter believes that this is an incorrect interpretation The strong weak distinction unknown vs unknowable seems to be an interesting approach to allowing miracles in a sense to exist I ll have to spend some time on the SEP article it looks excellent as you would expect,0
Maybe you should take a look at my track record before this latest incident I ve only even been blocked once and that was way back when I was a newbie here and even then the block was unwarranted It was the result of an already on going editwar over an article between multiple editors An admin stepped in and blindly mass blocked everyone who had made edits while the conflict was going on and my edit wasn t even involved Ultimately that admin lost his admin privileges as a result of their action and my ban was removed because it was unwarranted although it s still on my record I ve been a editor here for years and yeah I had my angry bouts with people but none have ever resulted in a block before So why don t you cut me some slack,0

Ancient Iraq did not exist Indeed when you click on the link to Ancient Iraq it goes to Mesopotamia Greece Egypt China and Iran Persia all actually existed in one form or another in ancient times and were actually called by those names Iraq did not exist Look at the published histories of the ancient world and you will not find the term Iraq except as a reference to the modern country and modern boundaries The books you googled all speak of the ancient world in reference to the modern country and its boundaries not to an ancient entity We could just as easily write a book about Ancient Andorra which described Paleo and Neolithic sites Iraq did not exist in ancient times unlike Greece Egypt China and Persia And to remind you the usually called Mesopotamia should be a clue to you that common usage is Mesopotamia And as well Mesopotamia also encompasses eastern Turkey western Iran and eastern Syria This is a well known widely understood and more commonly occurring term than ancient Iraq going back to usages 2500 years ago Iraq is a completely modern term,0
I stumbled across this when I saw a link just disappear under me as I was reading it Why are you removing links to the LINGUIST List MultiTree project Are you a linguist Are you aware that the project is funded by the National Science foundation and is seen as one of the major linguistic informational sites You don t seem to have any problems with seeing multiple links to the Ethnologue site on every language page so why are you trying to remove links to a site which in the linguistic world is considered just as important I mean this is silly Are you saying that if someone hears of a great site that deals with languages he can t link the languages he s involved with to it,0

Two things it s not generally considered unduly self serving to use a reference by the creator of a thing to support a fact about that thing New Super Mario Bros contains multiple references published by Nintendo and that s a featured article Presumably if this violated WP SPS the article wouldn t have passed the FA process As for why it s relevant there s a big difference between mere memorabilia like a hat or a keychain and a slot machine given that the latter is essentially a multimedia video game spinoff in its own right The slot machine uses graphics sound and game mechanics similar to that of the original game It also illustrates that Plants vs Zombies is considered a well known enough game that someone thinks a slot machine version of it would draw in customers I would agree that a full blown article on this slot machine title would be overdoing it but frankly I consider the level of opposition against a one sentence mention of the machine as well as what appears to be the near universal misunderstanding of what WP SPS is attempting to accomplish to be rather unbelievable,0
A 2006 paper using the definition,0
The reason that the Fourier basis functions are generalized eigenfunctions of derivatives is because derivatives are translation invariant and the Fourier basis functions are the characters of the translation group and the Fourier transform is essentially a projection operator Various books on harmonic analysis define Fourier transforms more generally in terms of projection operators for arbitrary symmetry groups usually subsets of the Euclidean group and as the article notes the cases of non Abelian groups e g in crystallography lead to an interpretation more subtle than eigenfunctions because of the possible existence of irreducible representations with dimension 1 So from this perspective symmetry groups are much more fundamental than eigenfunctions of specific operators that happen to be invariant under those symmetries On the other hand it s true that I have also seen a few authors refer to expansion in arbitrary orthonormal bases as generalized Fourier series whether or not the basis stems from eigenfunctions or symmetry groups e g you could take any basis and use Gram Schmidt to orthogonalize and probably this should be mentioned in the article or in the Fourier series article I think it should be mentioned under generalizations however not in the lede and it should be emphasized that this terminology of generalized Fourier series is not universally adopted many authors reserve the term Fourier to refer specifically to basis sets derived from the translation group or at least from some subgroup of the Euclidean group,0

My impression is Holy Roman Emperor is different both from King of the Romans Rex Romanorum and from King of Germany because you only get to be emperor if you re crowned by the pope in Rome Not all the elected kings of Germany kings of the Romans got to be Holy Roman Emperor The distinction between King of the Romans Rex Romanorum and King of Germany is much muddier to me I don t really care which formulation is used but I was hoping there would be some consistent principle that would say Everyone before 1300 was King of Germany and everyone after was King of the Romans or something like that I don t think I m going to revisit any of the formulations in the articles unless some clarifying principle is discovered,0

Because you think I m being vindictive when in fact all I think is that we need a clear policy If the policy is to revert on sight then it would have been impossible to scrub Miss Moppet it would have gone straight through FAR and probably be stubbified now I am trying to make a point we should have zero tolerance and everyone should know it I shouldn t have to put up with this shit because someone is dishonest or argue with you who I consider a friend They cheated and the page should go And then no one deals with it later no one cleans the mess and we all get on with our business And if I tell you that accusing me of wanting a star hurt then I ll get another ten messages about being a pretentious bitch and needing smelling salts,1

There was a huge debate on whether to include biblical stores in the mythology categories several months ago and the consensus was that they should not be there Please do not bring up the subject again,0
I don t know exactly how to go out writing it though just due to the sourcing problem For example Ill Nino predates the revival and the album generally agreed as incorporating metalcore first fits in the right period but I haven t been able to find a good source that explicitly states the inclusion of metalcore The one obvious objective sign of metalcore influence is that one of the tracks features the vocalist from Hatebreed which technically doesn t confirm metalcore influence ever though it s clearly there The reliable source that confirms metalcore influence is for their most recent album which came out after the start of the nu metal revival Based on that source they should be included not as predecessor but in the list but that s a clearly misleading conclusion For the Japanese bands one can look at this page and see that numerous of the listed artists are also listed as metalcore and at least The Gazette is actually cited for both but I haven t been able to find any reliable sources where someone put 2 and 2 together and concluded that Japan had the nu metalcore thing going before the American nu metal revival,0

The page is now very messy verging on the ridiculous I suggest you put the flags back pending wider agreement on this I would have reverted it myself but there have been additional uncontroversial edits in the mean time This Ulster Banner is a difficult one but we should try to avoid making it a politcal issue and err on the side of consistency like consistently have a flag for all players oh and some canvassing I see,0
It fits perfectly in the definition and formulas of the Coriolis force The Coriolis force is perpendicular to the movement and to the Earth s axis and proportional to the sine of the angle between them So something falling above the equator will veer East because of it Something falling at higher latitude will veer East as well but less At the pole there is no effect Reversely something moving East along the equator will drift upwards At higher latitude it will veer up at an oblique angle to the surface but straight from the Earth s axis Both effects are known under the name E tv s,0

I had removed the entire section since it is old not cited has only 1 working valid reference That single reference is for a short statement that does not represent the main idea of this entire section which is to degrade the view of the singular Orthodox conversions That Section could be summed to a single sentence which would mean nothing to differring Intra Orthodox views since in that 1 reference controversy all agree on the way of conversion just not about how it actually happened Please do not restore this this is old invalid biased and unreferenced if anyone thinks this one reference has any significance rephrase it into another section or something Do not restore a whole section of invalidities,0

Yes I think official and national languages read English in this case should come first indigenous languages second and immigrant languages and local developments such as creoles third Also within the indigenous languages I think Hawaiian should go last It s mentioned as an official language so it s not like it ll get lost and it s both rather recent historically as a Usonian possession I mean not as a language and rather marginal geographically marginal in the literal sense of at the margins It seems wrong to place it before Iroquois or Algonquian Speaking of which are we going to recognize Samoan Chamoro American Samoans are citizens in all but name and the Marianas incl Guam are clear Usonian possessions and will probably soon be upgraded to commonwealths Maybe the division could be Continental languages and Pacific languages or something along those lines 07 29 2005 Jun 8 UTC,0

The burdon of proof falls on you Yenchin and you have not provided any evidence to support your claims Simply because practitioners create songs paintings peoms etc about Mr Li does not mean that they worship him That logic is totally off In my 5 years of practicing Falun Gong although I ve heard of some people worshiping Mr Li I have NEVER seen anybody worship him I ve known one person who I heard does that but that s only what I heard This alone is enough to indicate that this behavior is not widespread Moreover the quotes by Happyingeneral are from multiple places in the central text of Falun Dafa which is a lot more than simply one of his writings And as I said the burdon of proof is yours not ours and it s pretty heavy,0

This should probably be discussed on the CFS talk page Do you have a reference for that one letter There have been lots of other instances of death threats etc so it doesn t make sense to dismiss it we discuss it elsewhere in the article I think We re not saying the entire patient group is militant just a small bunch of nutters Also see the talk page of the Simon Wessely article where this is discussed as well,0

I think that option 4 is a realy bad idea because it adds bloat For example One can argue that before the failure of the battle of Berlin air that the British as the Germans before them were committed to a state terror bombing campaign because they were trying to do massive material and morale damage to the enemy in a total war But after the failure of the battle of Berlin with the directive dated 25 September 1944 recommending that RAF Bomber Command concentrate on oil and communications targets which was the American position the former policy and hopes were abandoned The primary reason for bombing Dresden was for its communications links the secondary reason See Yalta was that it still had a relatively intact arms industry There is very little to no evidence that the Allied High Command expected to be able to alter German morale let alone Hitler s views by this raid I do not see how this explanation can be comfortably placed in the introductory section because it is so large when there is already a section where this can be covered if necessary To put Many why not some people regard the bombing as an act of state terrorism and many why not some do not is just POV with no useful information Many people regard the bombing as an act of state terrorism because they do not know about the directive dated 25 September 1944 recommending that RAF Bomber Command concentrate on oil and communications targets Would give a lot more information but would probably be unacceptable to you and would add bloat to the introduction when in could go into the appropriate section,0

Dear Opiner the book is taught in university It is published by a reliable press Let me explain a little bit When someone wants to publish a paper or a book he submits the draft to the press Then the press gives the draft to several reviewers to check The better the press the better the reviewers The reviewers make sure that every sentence in the paper book is factual otherwise it will be bad for the reputation of the press The University Text Book are the most reliable ones Yes there might even then be mistakes Everybody can publish write about Islam even non specialists But the press may not publish it If the writer is famous that would of course increase credentiality At the end of the day we can say Prof X in his book published by Y says Z,0

That is nonsense we quote blogs all the time and lots of other non peer reviewed sources The only think the lack of peerreview means is that we can t take the book as proof of acceptance by others than the authors It is perfectly valid to cite it as the opinion of those scholars and since some of the scholars are notable so are their opinions The paywakll argument is also not valid as most books have to be purchased whether it exists in any specific libraries is irrelevant Your argument is simply not supported by policy RS is also irrelevant since it is not used to support any claims but is only mentioned the only question at issue is notability,0

This is not science This is what Darwinian Evolutionists have branded as science and deceived society thereby Science is the intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behavior of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment In laymen s terms true science is observational and repeatable You were not present in the nascent universe unless you claim to be God You do not know for a fact the age of the Earth As C H Spurgeon once wrote Science is the method by which man tries to conceal his ignorance Your science is carbon dating which is completely based upon a uniformitarean system which history has proved inaccurate Even now we record great fluctuations in the C12 to C14 Ratio in the atmosphere which is destructive to the foundations of radiocarbon dating Man has influenced this enormously in the past one hundred years with nuclear bombs among other things It is impossible to get an accurate reading above approximately 60 000 years and extremely difficult to get an accurate reading above 20 000 years Many other tests have proved faults in carbon dating Look at the RATE Group C14 Dating cannot be taken as absolute etc the last one from Ken Ham s organization This article would do well to better reveal to the audience Ham s counterarguaments The same goes for radiometric dating in general I have listed here quite a few independent reliable sources That does not mean that what they say is a fact That does not mean their antagonists are correct It means that historical science is discovered through origins science which is EXTREMELY subjective Both sides take the same evidence but interprete it through different philosophical standpoints Evolutionists through Humanistic Naturalism just as much a religion as Christianity and Creationists through the Bible The method by which you decide to interprete the evidence is up to you but it is not fair or accurate to call it science or to deceive others into thinking so So in short the age of the Universe is not a fact and this Encyclopedia is biased Not towards science but towards the religion of Naturalism You have unfairly classified sources as unreliable because they contradict Darwinian Evolution Michael Ruse eminent Darwinian Athiest and scientific philosopher even states Evolution is promoted by its practitioners as more than mere science Evolution is promulgated as an ideology a secular religion a full fledged alternative to Christianity Evolution is a religion religion b 904828 html The only difference between Evolutionists and Creationists is that the former is hypocritical in denying the role their presumptions play in the outcomes of their studies and the latters embraces it So Throadislong please be fair Present both sides equally Especially considering this is a biography of one of the greatest Creationists of our day This is not a place to insert naturalist bias Philosophical presentation should be equal and in another section or article Each model should be presented objectively I plead with you for the sake of the ideology of the Media to present the facts fairly and in an unbias manner by changing this page Thank you Hyrcanus776,0

Pimen s statement is found in several Russian sources p 51 of this book and p 129 here Unless you have something proving that the statement is not authentic then there are no grounds for removing it LoveMonkey s recent edits are problematic as he only posts those sources that support his views some of the sources have nothing to do with the historical setting but are about the 19th and 21st centuries rather than the USSR There s also this comprehensive book about the Russian Orthodox Church proving that there wasn t persecution of that institution but that in the early years of the Soviet period elements of the church waged war against the country by joining with the Denikin and Kolchak regimes I doubt that those editing the article have any personal experience with Russia Concerning myself my cousin is a bishop in that part of the world and he entered seminary around 1980 and is also a veteran of the Soviet Army So these allegations of persecution are not appreciated by Russians and their neighbors Much of what s on this article consist of outright fabrications and should be removed Citing the unreliable source Yakovlev this article claims that 100k priests were executed But this source here proves that Yakovlev fabricated the claims as part of his anti Soviet campaign It s because of articles like this why Wikipedia is such a joke it is written by amateurs with no social life and who have zero qualifications In articles throughout this site I find dubious research methods and unreliable sources This is to be expected as it would be unlikely that an academic would waste his time with something he wouldn t get paid for,0

And a further argument against merging is that the rotary engine has this name anyone knows any other name since more than a hundred years and Mr Felix Wankel was even born 1902 after the rotary engine has been invented So if someone calls the Wankel engine a rotary engine this is probably wrong and only because the wankel engine today is much more popular than the rotary engine although still not very popular,0

I understand from your comment that you don t find it an expression of anti Christian sentiment to burn New Testament bibles However Wikipedia is not interested in personal opinions but rather confines itself to reporting what has already been stated in other reliable sources It is irrelevant what you or I think on the matter It s sufficient if the facts have been shown elsewhere which is the case Media outlets around the world have reported on this incident The following sources show this in the light of anti Christian sentiment Orthodox Jews set fire to hundreds of copies of the New Testament in the latest act of violence against Christian missionaries in the Holy Land USA Today Haaretz It also has concerned evangelical Christians in North America Europe and Asia who visit Israel by the hundreds of thousands CNN The International Christian Embassy Jerusalem which has in the past resisted criticism of Israel has called the burning of the Christian Holy Book unacceptable and offensive to most Christians The Christian Post Including information that comes from reliable sources is all that is required here If you would like to add other cited perspectives I would be happy for you to include them in the article Or if you would like to argue the sources themselves please feel free to do so Nevertheless arguing what you yourself believe to be pertinent according to your opinion is of no consequence nor is it grounds for omitting this information from the article Your statement it s all about barely news worthy incidents like spitting and graphitti sic whereas no one has made an effort to report many notable incidents like murders which are occurring represents your point of view Those being spat at for years would no doubt disagree with you as would those Christians who were submitted to graffiti which read Death to Christians and We ll crucify you on their churches Once again I stress neither your point of view nor mine has any place in this article I would hope that after your numerous edits here at Wikipedia you would be aware of this Certainly adding other sourced information regarding other incidents to the article would only improve it further but that is certainly no reason to seek to delete what has already been added and adequately cited Finally concerning your comment about previous consensus I do not see any consensus being achieved from the five editors who participated in the brief discussion The penultimate comment by in fact states editors can t come to any agreement as to where it should go Regardless consensus can change overtime and I would be more than willing to open this up to a wider community through an RfC to get a better consensus concerning whether the incident is deemed anti Christian sentiment and if it is warranted to be included in this article I certainly believe it is I have been bold and reinserted it The latest edit combines those elements from my understanding that you wish to keep along with those that I believe equally must be included Call it a compromise that satisfies neither one of us 100 it is better than nothing Should you delete it I will take that as a sign that an RfC would be beneficial thus putting an end to what is turning into an edit war,0

or preferably only for times after 1921 Why Because this is English Wikipedia not Arabic Wikipedia The meaning of Arabic Ir q is irrelevant for usage of English Iraq which is a loanword and as such does not necessarily have the same meaning as the source term in the original language The OED defines the meaning of the English term Iraqi as A native or inhabitant of Iraq a republic in the Persian Gulf formerly before 23 Aug 1921 known as Mesopotamia unambiguously stating that in English usage Mesopotamia is the term of choice for referring to the region in contexts of periods predating 1921 Thank you the rudeness is entirely yours You can expect to be corrected politely once or twice or even four times but at some point your insistence in spite of all warnings and corrections becomes simple WP DISRUPT and disruptive behaviour is rude,0

I don t know when you are speaking of when I said earlier that I was rewriting It seems a long time ago that I was trying to do actual writing in this article but as I recall it you reverted what I did so my constructive efforts were undermined If you are suggesting that you would back off a bit and allow some editing that would be refreshing It may be that I wanted to start by deleting a chunk or all of the Harrison text and you were then insisting that the whole Harrison text stay I also do not understand your accusations that I impose the Harrison text blocks upon the reader I would prefer to remove them entirely Please comment further,0

I appreciate your efforts Spangineer but you are unaware of some of the history involved in this Some people have been using Spanish WP to spout political propaganda about Gibraltar and to spread lies and generally be offensive to the people of Gibraltar I tried to make NPOV edits but Dodo Ecemaml sefl proclaimed themselves dictators of es and abused their positions as Admins to deny the WHOLE of Gibraltar access to es This unjustifiable restriction remains in force I have received considerable abuse from several wikis including Ecemaml He proved in es beyond doubt that his intentions are mischievous He appears obsessed with blackening the name of Gibraltar WP is NOT a discussion forum and an article about a country territory or city should be simply information about it presented in a neutral fashion Sometimes alternative POV s on an issue can be presented but most of the time it is quite possible to word something from a neutral viewpoint without being at all controversial If anyone wants to expound spanish anti Gibraltar propaganda they may do so but NOT on WP There are other forums for this,0

As I said Athanasian Trinitarianism does not own the phrase God the Father It s a Biblical term and is a phrase used by Modalists and Arian Christians obviously not in a trinitarian sense And the article reflects that throughout and always has And the lede should NOT give the false impression right off the bat by only just mentioning the blatant trinitarian view of God the Father solely to the exclusion of literally everything else inaccurately and in POV style when it s long been established that God the Father is not the exclusive title of trinitarians and never was Talk to any Oneness Pentecostal Modalist and ask him if he thinks the term God the Father refers to the first person of the Christian trinity of three co equal persons Father Son and Spirit and see what his response is They obviously don t believe that nor hold to that Neither do Jehovah s Witnesses in their Unitarian or Semi Arian view It s just lopsided regardless of what John Carter keeps going on about to make the WHOLE LEDE just about that alone It does not reflect the article correctly or accurately nor is it even true nor sourced God the Father yes does refer in Trinitarian circles generally to the first person of their Trinity but that phrase does not never has and never will be ONLY referring to that Period And there are plenty of sources and books and refs that prove that fact And the point of the article again regardless of the name God the Father title was about the overall concept of God AS Father in general including the Trinitarian Nicean concept But not exclusively As with Modalists Arians Semi Arians or even Judaism Good day,0

I m sorry but once again you re pointing to something the paper Typologies of Extreme Longevity Myths primarily authored by the notorious Ryoung122 which proves something quite different than what you think it does The paper s abstract asserts that Invalid age claim rates are 65 at age 110 111 with the clear implication which you have adopted that invalid should be interpreted as false But that s not backed up by the details given in the paper s text which says something else entirely In the comparison of supercentenarian cases generated by the Social Security Death Index to a validated list generated by the GRG one observes that the rate of validation is 35 at age 110 111 The 35 comes from this table wherein we see that the US Social Security Death Index lists 610 Total claims i e persons listed as 110 111 of whom the Number validated the number for which Mr Young was able to find acceptable documentation was 219 And 219 610 35 validated leaving 65 not validated The problem is not validated isn t the same as false A thorough attempt to validate an age claim would have to include searches of local school church and public records local newspapers for birth announcements etc hospital records and any number of other potential sources as well as contacting surviving family We often hear that a validation was blocked by the inability to contact family and gain their cooperation Clearly Young and his helpers could not possibly have brought such exhaustive efforts to bear on every one of these 610 individuals And that s just for the 110 111 age range the table lists almost 3000 people ages 109 120 In other words the 65 of cases not validated simply means well that they weren t validated i e for whatever reason appropriate documentation wasn t found In some cases this will be because the case is in fact false but in others it s because the documentation is out there somehwere but wasn t found by Young with the time and resources he had And there s no way to tell how many cases are one or the other The interpretation that two thirds of claims are false is complete nonsense The reason for this mess is that Young made the most rookie of all rookie blunders which is to attempt to use the entire population of cases as his sample This never works because spreading your time and resources over the entire population inevitably gives you far lower data quality than would be obtained by concentrating on gathering high quality data for a smaller sample The right way to estimate the true proportion of valid cases would be to take a sample e g N 100 and really beat the bushes to do a completely thorough job on that smaller number instead of a sloppy partial job on the population of 3000 This would yield an estimate of the proportion of true claims which is something like 5 percentage points off the true proportion To be frank I m shocked by the low quality of the statistical thinking on display in this paper especially since some at least of the authors are well known researchers I can only guess that changes were made especially to the abstract late in the publication cycle without full review,0

Correction The film is a well done polished documentary based on the world we re living in which couldn t be fiction And a newspaper article is a documentary but doesn t pose itself as one because it s common sense It s common sense because it s a document The events in the film were not fictitious there were no actors in the film Like I said it was just a very well done documentary that seemed like it was staged Unsigned,0

The actual article refers to Luke and Matthew placing the nativity in Bethlehem not that it definitely really did happen there I think you are referring to a back and forth about categories that has been going on the last few days The category People born in Bethlehem does not say People who were born in Bethlehem 100 for sure it could be taken to mean People whose birth is said to have been in Bethlehem Anyway the information in the article is much more important than categories in my opinion,0
Another vote for keeping the section intact,0
I think the difference was actually more clear before you edited because it deliberately used the phrase political successor implying he wasn t necessarily the successor in other ways e g spiritual Your version is subject to various understandings of what successor means If you want to introduce the fact that a lot of muslims were opposed to Abu Bakr being caliph or that they continued not to accept him as Muhammad s successor in other ways I think that s fine as long as you have verbiage explaining why that s relevant to the prelude to the Battle of Yarmouk But I would leave the existing sentence which appears to be crisp and accurate and add another as additional information As the article stands all that matters is that he was Caliph because the text goes on to talk about the wars in which he was a military leader,0

Point being Tewfik that it s a bad idea to make this list s central criteria an argument about intent as that is a principle source of hot dispute among both RSs and Wikipedians Both those who are pressing for this criterion and those resisting it moreover want this to be a list of Palestinian attacks on Israeli non combatants in other words everyone wants the same list But some want that list to impress upon the reader through its title the argument that only Palestinians not Israelis stage attacks on non combatants There are many RSs who find this argument uncompelling so to build it into the title is a violation of WP NPOV At any rate when both sides agree what a list s contents are to be the choice between a contentious and non contentious title should be a no brainer You go with the latter always Lists exist so that the reader may have organized information at his fingertips not so that he may have intractable ethical questions resolved for him by Wikipedians,0
I also don t see a problem We can t say that a particular site is an RS or not RS it depends on what is being cited to the article I ve re checked the article and what is cited to the source it is only used to either report indisputable facts e g Amen s websites market vitamin supplements and a branded range of other dietary supplements or clearly states the authors opinions neurologist Robert A Burton criticized PBS for the airing of these programs If we were using the headline that would obviously be a problem but we aren t We can tone down a sensationalist source and get good information from it,0

Dude you are clearly a complete joke You wasted all that time writing the above paragraph to me even though you obviously didn t fully read what I wrote I can t write clearly actually I have a Masters degree what do you have Maybe it s you who can t read clearly Then rather than getting embarrassed and apologizing for looking like a complete fool you actually have the nerve to attack me once again And to accuse me of being biased in defending Rick Warren while you attack him while being an atheist is unbelievably hypocritical You have absolutely no class,1
Yeah anyone at all can object to non admin closures and in fact about the only time they re objected to is by someone involved in the discussion It s more common to have the closure reviewed but it s also standard operating procedure to just revert a NAC when the closer is obviously engaging in a supervote as appears to be the case here A closer who has previously been deeply involved in the issue is not a neutral party just because they sit out the RfC and then pop in at the end to close it the way they would have voted That s just a form of wiki link or looks like it if it wasn t intentional A good rule of thumb is to ask yourself after reviewing a discussion do I care enough that I would have voted in this If the answer is no then proceed If they answer is yes and you re closing it against how you would have voted proceed or vote yourself and walk away If yes and you d close it the way you d like to see it end instead vote yourself and walk away I also walk away if the decision is not very clear cut and my close would not maintain the current status quo since that would be likely to generate a challenge of the closure better to let an admin do it,0
Well in that case I ll revert I d understand if the references were from say the last century but saying that a reference from 2005 is historic is simply pointless and it won t advance your own opinions as to the rest of the article any further,0

Yes it s very much an ownership issue I also have doubts about all the tags Peter Isotalo have placed since this discussion started As an admin explains in this discussion it appears that when a consensus went again Peter Isotalo on another article he started adding templates and removing content with a vengeance just as we ve seen here in the last day So I thank and suggest we proceed as proposed and just delete and report further disruptions from Peter,0
Not to repeat what I and others have said Gabriel but let me see whether I understand your argument You re saying that 20 4 years after the detection of the planet we ll be able to say it exists now That is in 2027 we ll be able to say The planet currently exists because the duration of the observations will equal the length of time for light to get here from there This doesn t follow there s no connection between the length of time it s been observed for and the justification for saying it exists in the present tense As soon as it was discovered its presumed age was over 4 billion years the same as its star Thus my analogy to Pluto is a good one And no the encyclopedia should not mention possibilities with negligible probability For instance it is a fact that Queen Elizabeth I of England may have been chromosomally male XY with androgen insensitivity syndrome No one can prove she wasn t and the probability is greater than 1 20 000 Yet this unfounded speculation does not belong in Wikipedia,0
Your answer is rather superficial and somewhat misleading while Wikipedia articles are always encouraged to talk about the subject as it pertains to people across the globe this is an English language neologism As for WP NEWSORG and WP RS MC the term is not biomedical or medical in use not a psychological condition or disorder and not presented as such in the article Demanding academic sources for biomedical assertions is a red herring and completely irrelevant,0

I didn t say it was a disk All I said was that the word orbis does not mean sphere It is the Latin translation of the biblical word used in Isaiah 40 22 and other places to describe the circle of the earth Your idea that the orb may have signified the universe or cosmos certainly has roots in the ancient Roman usage and may possibly be why the symbol survived Having said that have a look at this picture from that article It certainly seems that at least one medieval iconist thought that a disk was a more appropriate representation As for flat earth theories between 1870 and 1970 have a look at the section Modern flat earthers It has a rather fuller list,0

The relevance of quoting Ferdinand Columbus is that Russell makes out that there was no record of anyone challenging Columbus on these grounds before Irving s biography described it Elsewhere on Wikipedia Irving s account was described as a fantasy whereas in fact it won awards in Spain England and the US from learned societies It was possibly the first American account and that is its main relevance Pretty obviously it has nothing to do with fears of falling off the edge of the world and the popularity of flat earth accounts didn t appear for nearly 50 years after its publication Irving did his research in Spain and there s no indication that any of the modern authors such as Russell have done anything like as thorough a job It is noteworthy that modern biographers regarded as reliable such as Felipe Fernandez Armesto repeat the Augustine story As far as I m concerned the jury is still out on Irving s other examples such as the hide covering the earth He probably had sources for them even where more modern historians would discount them for example Bartolom de las Casas an account still not widely available in its full version I m sorry but the Augustine quote does challenge the idea that the earth was round He is quoted as saying it s impossible to sail round and for purely theological reasons There are many other confused ideas recorded in Fernando Columbus s account of the commission such as many learned men were in disagreement on whether the ocean was infinite a clear reference to the Homeric legend and tales of sailing downhill and therefore not being able to return uphill These are all the signs that people had heard stories that the earth was round and didn t quite understand or believe or accept it It seems that people today are so used to seeing pictures from satellites and the moon that they can t really imagine the difficulty that people had of conceptualising a round earth particularly before anyone had actually sailed round it The tenacity with which many in the United States in particular clung on to a flat earth theory between 1870 and 1970 is just an indication of how appealing the idea is All of those people had also heard of the idea of a spherical globe and rejected it Most of us who received our education before the space age got used to the idea by looking at globes But no one in Christian Europe ever made a globe before 1492 although they got used to the idea of the spherical heavens by using astrolabes That in itself is a strong indication that the idea of the earth as a sphere was far from being fully accepted The fact that the globus cruciger became known as an orb the word means circle not sphere underlines the fact that since the word for sphere was never used in the bible for the earth it was therefore a risky idea for people scared of clerical authority,0

The thing about primary sources is not that they can t be used but that we must be very careful not to misrepresent them In a BLP this even more critical than in other types of articles I have used primary sources several times where pertinent information is just not found anywhere eles ie A Comparison of Rare Gas Flashlamps or the U S Naval Flight instruction manual However I wouldn t feel comfortable using these if I didn t have some experience in the matters and fully understand the information Synthesis and misinterpretation is a very easy trap to fall into without even knowing it especially the latter It is also often a method to slip in information that isn t particularly notable in any other way ie Does Wikipedia need to report every single movie song and computer game which uses the term barrel roll in an article about the aerial maneuver If primary sources are used extreme care needs to be exercised In a majority of cases if the info is notable it will have been reported elsewhere,0
The information from those sections can be relocated to stub articles that s fine But note how the Red Dwarf article contains more information about the programme s characters for example than the stub that is allocated for that purpose The stub is the place for that expansion of information I still think that the sections above should be removed from the article entirely and relocated to stubs with maybe a line of summary for each in the process of linking to that stub,0

interpretation of NFCC 8 no valid article specific NFCC rationale is dead wrong and IMO verges on vandalism The policy states Non free content is used only if its presence would significantly increase readers understanding of the topic and its omission would be detrimental to that understanding This painting precisely needs to be seen to increase readers understanding of the topic Don t do it again The image is specifically mentioned in the text about the art collection the image is of an important part of the art collection and in case you don t know this is an article about an art museum Visual art needs to be seen read WP NFCC more carefully,0

Seriously You judge a film and an actor s success by only Filmfare award nominations especially when they are controversial for being biased I am sure you also know well renowned veteran actor Rishi Kapoor in fact admitted he had bought Best Actor award once by using his money Basically the budget noticibly remarkable acting skills box office mega success critically acclaimed reviews and audience s ravishing response is not the criteria but an award show nomination is the criteria according to you And filmfare has this new rule that an artist does not get more than 2 nominations in the same category Because of which Deepika didnt get 3rd nomination of Best Actress for YJHD after her nominations in CE and RL in 2014 filmfare Deepika again didnt get 3rd Best Actress nomination for her well known spectacular performance in Tamasha after being nominated in same category for Piku and BM Even Alia Bhatt didnt get her third Best Actress nomination in Kapoor Sons after being nominated for Udta Punjab and Dear Zindagi In such a case any artist will not have more than 2 films in Selected filmography for same year DESPITE ravishing successful and memorable talented performance in other multiple films Seriously I am so done here Selected Filmography should define films in which she herself as an actress gained critical acclaim for her acting which audience remembers forever not because of merely an award show nominated it or not Filmfare shouldnt be the only lonely criteria for selected filmography,0

I suggest that we need to minimize the present article down to what is actually needed So for example is all the discussion of failed attempts at earthquake prediction those attempts that do not seem to have a valid scientific basis necessary or is the volume of material devoted to those methods really necessary as compared to other methods that actual scientists are pursuing For example there has been some attempt to have introduced to this article material covering satellite projects devoted to earthquake prediction some of those satellites are already in orbit But this doesn t seem to satisfy Johnson who keeps deleting it On the other hand we have material on Browning lots of material on using animals etc To most scientists these methods have no scientific basis Yes we can cover some crack pot ideas but this needs to be put into a balance with methods that scientists are actually trying to use evidence that some scientists actually consider valid etc To make headway we can possibly get rid of material that doesn t much contribute so for example we might get rid of quote boxes we might reduce coverage of crack pot methods Preceding unsigned comment added by,0

I am rather surprised that most of the cultural aspect in the Paris article seems to be limited to the early of the 20th century Espect few aspect like the opening of the Branly museum which is wrongly depict as the newest museum of Paris we are in 2014 this is not 2006 8 years have happened and several museums have opened during this period there are very few things about Paris modern culture The music France and Paris have one of the largest hip hop scene in the world Why nothing is said about this in this article nor in music of Paris article Yet the rap is more popular among the population than the accordion which is pretty much restricted to tourism trade The cusine seems to be too limited on french foods while Paris is full of restaurants from all over the world and especially its former colonies we need to make the reader understand that the food in Paris is not limited to French cuisine The current sentence about this is not clear It can be understood as almost every cuisine from the sole France because the previous sentence only speak about the internal migration and not the international migration About the festivals in my opinion too much is said about the Bastille day history but almost nothing about other festivals No Gay pride no Chinese New Year no Techno parade no Nuit Blanche No f te de la Musique Obviously I just wrote few limited examples among many others and while the role of this article is not to list everything that exist in Paris the absence of some important points is problematic in the understanding of the city It gives the impression that Paris culture stopped at WW2 I don t think that somebody reading the section culture of Paris could understand the contemporary culture of Paris This section needs an overhaul not in its structure which is good but in its informations,0

Each of these are just one line profiles Probably because that s what Wu told her interviewers One also says feminist warrior should we include that In fact neither Feminism nor feminist is mentioned in the article Is that an omission I am not enough of an expert to know if Wikipedia considers these one line profiles as a reliable source but if you restore the title software engineer and include these sources as proper citations I will not revert Keep in mind personally I will remain unconvinced I have seen Wu s Twitter feed after this was cited for quickly reverting my edits Wu states that she took some computer science classes at age 13 with the exclamation It s true However the rest of her education and took her in vastly different directions I took computer science classes at age 14 I took electives evening classes etc I trace my computer languages back to BASIC Pascal and through to C and SQL Yet I wouldn t even dare to describe myself as a programmer and software engineer would be preposterous I take extreme exception to your claim that software engineer is the same as a programmer Yes they overlap Software engineers are more than capable of being programmers but not vice versa Also while certifications and regulations vary by country the engineer part is a very high standard I quote from the linked page The United States starting from 2013 offers an NCEES Professional Engineer exam for Software Engineering thereby allowing Software Engineers to be licensed and recognized 25 Mandatory licensing is currently still largely debated and perceived as controversial In some parts of the US such as Texas the use of the term Engineer is regulated by law and reserved only for use by individuals who have a Professional Engineer license The IEEE informs the professional engineer license is not required unless the individual would work for public where health of others could be at risk if the engineer was not fully qualified to required standards by the particular state Professional engineer licenses are specific to the state that has awarded them and have to be regularly retaken I hope you take my words into consideration before you haphazardly bestow the title software engineer on Wu s biography page Despite what Wu alleges on Twitter I am not a GamerGater but I find it worrisome that she can just tweet and have people revert good faith edits without sources Cheers and happy editing,0

Tewfik you re ignoring the fact that significant and reliable sources describe some Israeli attacks as targeting civilians In February 2003 for example Human Rights Watch stated that Israeli soldiers repeatedly used indiscriminate and excessive force killed civilians willfully and unlawfully and used Palestinian civilians as human shields Amnesty said last year that Many of the Palestinians killed by Israeli forces in the Occupied Territories were involved in armed confrontations and attacks However the majority were not and they were killed as a result of deliberate and reckless shooting artillery shelling or air strikes by Israeli forces carried out in densely populated residential areas Both sources also discuss the Israeli policy of assassination targeted killing and conclude that it is politically motivated and not a legitimate security tactic And we ve established above that the world condemned the Shehada aistrike and Ari Fleischer took pains to distinguish between collateral damage and a deliberate attack on the site knowing that innocents would be lost Now we understand that notable POV s including your own hold that this nebulous concept of intent is the moral fulcrum upon which the Middle East conflict turns and that Israeli actions involve a stark moral contrast to Palestinian ones But what we re waiting for you to understand is that this is not the only significant view of the subject and thus it must not be allowed to dominate the article I have yet to see any policy or RS based refutation of this point instead you re trying to convince us that your side s view of the conflict is correct Well whether it s correct or not it s still a disputed point of view and we write articles to a neutral point of view As you well know,0

Huh I m not sure why I never questioned Horowitz s claim I m also not sure how the blatant source falsification that you discovered made it through this article s FAC review Jaguar routinely gets away with that sort of thing during the GAN process but I would have hoped that FAs are held to a higher standard I guess I somehow imagined that Naka was working at STI in parallel with the Sonic X treme team during the period that the latter requested Naka s Nights engine and was rebuffed it s possible that I also took this Wikipedia article to provide corroboration of Horowitz s account But you re right Naka returning to the U S shortly after being offered a producer position in Japan doesn t make a whole lot of sense on its face and the sourcing is weak,0
If I knew the answer I wouldn t have asked the question Better has no objective meaning it has to be based on something like improved nutrient content less corn syrup less infamy improved taste cheaper production cost etc It would not be particularly remarkable if the company discontinued a less controversial product but this particular product is controversial If it were discontinued and reliable information were available as to why it would be interesting and notable Get back to us if when you find some WP RS,0
Following the above I propose Singh s lawyers noted that the court case was seen as a rallying point for supporters of the scientific method and that they were forced to concede to technicality due to the high costs of proving the intentionally and knowingly fake practices of chiropractors They said it is the price he has paid for writing an article criticising sic the BCA for making claims the Advertising Standards Authority has ruled can no longer be made ref name dropped,0

Is there a peer reviewed citation for the not being able to undo it My interpretation was that it referred to the consequences not the CO2 forcing Of course we cannot change CO2 past CO2 forcing but future forcing can easily be changed by reducing emissions seeding the oceans etc Paleoclimate studies show that CO2 levels have been higher in the past and thus reversal is physically possible Thermo haline circulation has also changed back and forth in the past What ever the claim is must be overstated unless it is limited to the past which nobody can change,0
Some newer editors have taken the liberty to remove an criticism found in the intro which noted the now resolved random shutdown issues of early MacBook s While I agree that this issue may no longer affect the MacBook it is still most certainly relevant Wikipedia is an encyclopedia therefore all relevant and well documented information relating to the entire history of a product whether resolved or not should be included This is not a sales page for Apple but an account on the entire history good or bad of the product The criticism in question was well sourced NPOV and integrated into the article instead of a separate section to further add to their objectivity I hope to encourage some discussion regarding this I have re added it for the reasons noted If you disagree with me please do so here and we can work out a consensus,0

It was only tortuous because Beyond My Ken and possibly you too knowingly edits against Wikipedia policy and consensus For example RfC where Beyond My Ken is told the location of the refimprove tag must be at the top yet he placed it at the bottom He does this in many other articles too Discussion where there is consensus Beyond My Ken s interpretation of WP V is wrong and there is no inherently referenced material yet he removed the citation needed tags because the material is inherently referenced He also keeps editing against the consensus of the RfC mentioned in that discussion You see it really shouldn t be tortuous if you follow Wikipedia policies and consensus instead of knowingly editing against them,0

Lost me there Vaccinations runs on the theory germs are the only factor in disease fact not from an a v site either and vaccination the only fact likewise defence No it doesn t Try Google and host factors or a medical textbook of course Have a go at de Lessops adnteh Panama Canal it is an interesting disease and multifactorail in all directions You seem to be complicating things I deny that The world is complicated and occasionally I manage to elucidate a part of it It is a toxemic host with smallpox that was living in and drinking filth made more vulnerable by nutrient deficincies The several forms of these intestinal crises or drunks follow holidays or feast days The lightest drunks are named colds flu tonsilitis the heaviest diphtheria In those who eliminate through the skin the eruptive fevers the lightest form is called measles the heavier scarlet fever the heaviest black smallpox Children Their Health and Happiness by J H Tilden 1928 Smallpox and diphtheria now both very rare have long since been cleaned up by the sanitary engineers Chickenpox Measles by Dr Bieler I think you should be able to get where anti vaccine disease theory is coming from Disease comes from WITHIN essentially and it can be tranmitted if the other person host is in a similar toxemic state and this has been wildly exagerated by vaccinators over the years smallpox being a notable example When you consider the fact they feared measles more in Leicester around 1880 you can get some idea about the extent of the fearmongering So far as we are concerned in Leicester a town containing 120 000 inhabitants with many thousands of unvaccinated children smallpox seems to be about the least dangerous of all diseases and is not to be named by the side of scarlet fever measles whooping cough diarrhoea or even consumption If a case of small pox is discovered instant isolation is adopted and during the last five years we have hardly had five deaths That being the state of the case one need not wonder that the fear of the disease should disappear or that resistance to vaccination should increase William Tebb 1881 fact One dude though it so uninfectious he thought onlt bedbugs could transmit it This child although living in the same room with the patients at the Pest House had not acquired the smallpox after being exposed to it all of the time for a period of six weeks yet upon the fifth day after returning home this child acquired the initial fever I then examined their house and found it to be literally alive with bedbugs CHARLES A R CAMPBELL M D And you have to marvel at people falling for the germ theory when most people don t catch the diseases As a matter of fact perhaps it is safe to say that not more than 10 per cent of the people ever would take smallpox if sleeping in the same bed with an infected smallpox victim Dr Hay,0

Yes they did although surpressed by attempts of Slavic violent dominance as expected However Bosnia and Bosnians or Bosniaks have existed as a concept right after the fall of Roman Empire as people who live around the river Bosona Roman Illyrian However due to very mountainous terrain in Bosnia Slavs avoided Bosnia as anthropologically expected which explains why these people learned to speak Slavic language it was in order to trade with the Slavic people who surround them and yet quite exclusively share no genetic similarities with Serbs and Croats By the way Bosniaks share no genetic heritage with Ukrainians or Slavs for that matter whatsoever Bosniaks frequent the I haplogroup roots most intensely as Oxford Uni confirms,0
The belligerents section is starting to go wild again Although wiki link participated in some zoint activities with wiki link I do not think it s appropriate to identify all of its leadership as part of the commanders and leaders of the war especially including intelligence Zuma and political Tambo Sisulu leadership amongst the military And Zuma was not even heading up DIS by the end of the war that followe din the 1980s Joice Mujuru was not at the same level of seniority in wiki link as her husband Tongogara or others not mentioned such as Tungamirai Agree on all this Also not sure geopolitical pic has come out as intended cannot see which are other nations friendly to the nationalist guerrillas not knowing what camel is as a colour or is it meant to be everyone except SA Not sure countries such as Malawi Zaire really played a comparable role to Mozambique or Zambia,0

Mr Ashmoo it is expedient for you to discuss such editing before you take yourself off on a frolic of your own Mr Ashmoo you will have to be able to show two things to remove the image 1 that it is wikipedia policy that where an image does not add something that the text doesn t it is to be removed 2 that the particular image does not add something that the text doesn t The particular image invokes a sense of the event to complement the text the NSW police beleive such otherwsie they would have merely released a text statement All the images on the page are unnecessary according to your reasoning as none of them add anything that the text doesn t The image shows three Middle Eastern attackers who stabbed a man for no other reason than he was a white Australian the racists used a knife and car as shown in the image the image invokes a sense of realism to complement the text AMONTHEMERCIFUL,0

These sites shame readers and proponents of GamerGate with attempts to appeal to their humanism effectively coercing emotional responses Instead of objectively reporting on a cultural dilemma these journalists become personally involved Much of this content is sensationalist in nature and is so saturated with bias that the writers neglect their duty to present clear dual sided content What readers are given instead is eerily similar to propaganda Sottek s piece feels like a personal tirade a kind of rant where he attempts to unceremoniously dismantle the movement while being oblivious to his favoritism of games journalist Leigh Alexander games developer Zoe Quinn and left wing feminist critic activist Anita Sarkeesian These outlets conveniently overlook the swath of offensive content found in Alexander s social media interactions on Twitter which have since been deleted It could even be argued that key websites support Alexander by writing smear content because of personal favoritism not professional courtesy and used their high standings in the media to retaliate Attacking GamerGate seems like a knee jerk reaction to a very real threat one that could out the media s established almost incestuous relationship with itself But even still the liberal media refuses to take responsibility for its part of the cultural rift simply because it doesn t see what it s done wrong This is not a media that s free of corruption This is a media that freely caters to liberal activism and shakes its finger at you for saying its wrong These are the most interesting quotes,0

I don t think that article is written for the general reader It is written for someone fascinated with a detailed description of period architecture It is an article on a National Park and a National Historic Landmark but it reads like an architectural article or worse See Hoysala architecture Even the Hoysala article ties the architecture into the context historically and culturally The Bathhouse article has little information in it except the lists of architectural details My opinion is that either the small part of the article that is relevant be merged with the National Park article or the article be rewritten to include the historical and cultural angles Isn t that where President Bill Clinton s mother used to go regularly when he was a kid It was supposed to be a swinging place back then risqu even Or get more into the geological aspects of hot springs,0

Hi So as you are an LDS member please clarify correct what is incorrect in the edit Mormon beliefs include the claim that the God the Father Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit are three separate beings not united under one monotheistic deity In addition Mormons believe that God the Father needed a physical body and is not made of spiritual substance in his own inherent divine nature Furthermore Mormon beliefs cite that souls who enter Heaven someday become deity like immortal and divine in equal footing with the Holy Trinity Regarding soteriology Mormon beliefs claim that the passion of Jesus Christ s crucifixion was not enough to merit redemption and salvation for humankind From what I understand from my teenage years these beliefs were true and in line accurate with my own Mormon Fellowship Group Because the Patheos website is an impartial website on religious beliefs and Mr Ben Wotherington has spent a great deal of time researching and comparing Mormon beliefs along with other Abrahamic religions Whatever is inaccurate please point out so it can be fact checked and revised as such,0
Lanier was a Southern historian and theologian during American Reconstructionism He produced his works for the head of the Atlanta Unitarian Church He self published them because just about EVERYONE in the South was self publishing them in the years following the Civil War including Samuel Clement a k a Mark Twain In fact Lanier and Mark Twain died about two years apart Lanier is an important part of the development of Unitarian theology which is why Union Theological Seminary which is non denominational and pro Unitarian digitized his writings and made them available This is NOT what Wikipedia was talking about in regards to the self publishing rule And of course you never notified me when you asked for an opinion on this reference since you are totally ignorant of who he was and what he did and hence did not convey the historical facts and importance of his writings to Unitarian thought to those who didn t know who he was either Books by John Jabez Lanier The Kinship of God in man Delvered to the head of the Atlanta Church The Church Universal a restatement of Christianity in terms of modern thought Delivered to Virginia Theological Seminary The Larger Church volumes I II Why I am a Christian Washington the Great American Mason The Song of Life Prayer the Soul s Desire Trying to remove Lanier as a reference is like trying to remove Luther or Samuel Clements as references because they self published too Absolutely idiotic Ike,0

Back on topic this article has to comply with due weight policy as has already been discussed at Other Hockey Stick Papers above While the paragraph in question isn t perfect and can be improved the point remains that it should always be clear which parts of the text describe the minority view and that it is in fact a minority view The majority view should be explained in sufficient detail that the reader may understand how the minority view differs from it and controversies regarding parts of the minority view should be clearly identified and explained Without this well sourced statement about the graph which is the subject of the article this policy would not be met Have you suggestions for improvements which would comply with policy,0

Aye I hated Roy s inaccuracy shallow and the jarring differences between others versions and his However my judgement was on his older texts He revised his analysis and added and removed lot of factors for which he no doubt was criticised for But I then quickly read through his latest books and looked out for them myself His latest books are all up to date and his analysis is far more mature albeit some of the info is incorrect not related to this topic here He has changed his stance about Chariots being abolished to them playing a marginal role in Indian history He has correctly stated that Greek CAVALRY is superior to Indian Pauravans not the entire army as a whole and also the part related to technology superiority of Greeks and no armour on Indian soldiers has also been removed I appreciate when intellectuals improve on their stances at embarassing degrees and I believe we all should laud their scholastic integrity I have not written anything about his speculative part in the edits the Indians were superior to Persians in combat effectiveness only his numerical analysis concurred by John M Kistler and Fuller both experts in their fields This is also proof that Porus is thus the one who is the most successful opponent against Alexander I will wait for 5 hours for your response then restore and rectify the edits My Edits will have consensus now of both You and Kansas Bear,0

And I certainly donot aggree with Binksternet The quote of Churchill is far out and not even the WILDEST estimates in the article supports his statement I suggested that Churchill is eliminated from the article it is pure nonsens I also added that Hasegawa has to be quoted CORRECTLY and that he claims page 299 as quoted by binkerstern that the many lives saved is a myth that cannot be supported by historical facts Find another quotation binkerstern if Hasegawa doesnt fit your point of view I also quoted 30 06 1998 Article International Review of the Red Cross No 323 CORRECTLY and updated the dead link Red in context that binkersten doesnt like it states The absence of positive law in this case treaty law certainly does not mean complete freedom in the use of means and methods tactics and technology Before brinkerstern vandalize good primary sources due to his biased view of the topic I expect him to critically evaluate the sources And he could start with Churchill what the frog can WC deliver of facts on the topic And now that I read this amateur have made a homemade statement on undefended cities I quote Shimoda et al v The State Tokyo District Court 7 December 1963 and updated the dead link that the principle of undefended cities can be applied to Hiroshima since an aerial bombardment with an atomic bomb brings the same result as a blind aerial bombardment from the tremendous power of destruction even if the aerial bombardment has only a military objective as the target of its attack it is proper to understand that an aerial bombardment with an atomic bomb on both cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was an illegal act of hostility as the indiscriminate aerial bombardment on undefended cities Part 2 International law aspects Letter litra 8 kindly Robertmossing,0
does populate a category but if you look at its message box you ll see it also asks the tagger to subst something into the translation requests page The tagger seems to have forgotten to do that I would have done it today but there are other options and I didn t know what you want The options I can see are make it a redirect losing content merge keeping some content keep and improve if you can figure out what it s saying or request translation The Hebrew article is much bigger I think the rosette symbol at its top may mean it s a featured article Translation isn t necessarily the only good course since the citations are in Hebrew and there may be a long wait for an available translator The only thing is if translation isn t wanted it would be good to remove the tag so that someone doesn t waste their time,0

Of the core content policies NPOV NOR V BLP only one discusses what should be in an article as opposed to what should be omitted The primary part of NPOV which applies to this article discussion is Achieving neutrality It has headings like Article structure Due and undue weight and so on That policy says that all significant points of view must be included Articles must not take sides but should explain the sides fairly and without bias This applies to both what you say and how you say it By failing to identify the weapon the article presents the POV that it was irrelevant unimportant trivial and unworthy of any mention whatsoever That s a legitimate POV but it isn t the only one Another POV for example is the one that says this gun had an easier trigger pull and that the frequency of guns being were drawn increased after the department bought them In other words that the gun did matter and that not all guns are the same That POV is significant as shown by the large number of gun publications and even gun articles on Wikipedia It is my contention that Wikipedia policy not only allows but actually requires that we include information of this type in proportion to its significance In this case we re only talking about twenty characters a SIG Sauer P320 WP NPOV is an important policy and it should be followed in deciding this matter,0

Dear All I am replacing my oringal post with the text of my entire correspondence with Wikipedia on these images the first letter includes my oringal post I am not told who the editors of this article are but should any like correspond with me please let me know how best to discuss this with you Having said that I doubt if an editor will every read this post given that everyone is generally being aggressive on this page It seems rather odd that we are not told about the academic backgrounds of the persons behind an article FROM SHIRAZ KIDWAI Subject Factually incorrect The portraits of Muhammad and the suggestion that these depicted factual information Dear Editor I read the article mentioned above assuming as usual that I would show factually correct information however I one factual error was immediately evident Factually incorrect The portraits of Muhammad and the suggestion that these depicted factual information No portraits of Muhammad were made in his life time and none were known to exist for up to 300 years after his death It will therefore be factually incorrect to show pictures of him and therefore suggesting to the reader that he looked like the particular person depicted in the pictures or for that matter that he lived in the settings depicted in the pictures This would be even more erroneous because part of the believe system he himself proclaimed required that no pictures paintings especially of human beings be made His followers a few billion of them do not therefore believe it correct to have a picture of Muhammad The paintings that are included in the article are made hundreds of years after the death of Muhammad and depict an artists impression of him rather than any factual correct impression You would therefore note that these depictions are contemporaneous to the time place they were made Persia Istanbul rather that to circa 600AD Arabia where Muhammad lived These pictures do garnish the article of similar nature but given the nature of facts and the fact that Muhammad himself did not allow his portraits to be made I think these pictures do not suite a wikepedia article which I have grown to know as hosting rigorously factual information I look forward to your response Yours sincerely Shiraz Kidwai FROM WIKIPEDIA Dear Shiraz Kidwai Thank you for your email Yes these images probably are inaccurate The artists who painted these images lived hundreds of years after Muhammad and could not have seen him themselves However similarly inaccurate images are used in articles for Homer Charlemagne Jesus and many other historical figures When no accurate images exist it is a longstanding tradition on Wikipedia to use images that are historically significant artwork and or typical examples of popular depictions Using images that readers understand might be inaccurate as long as those images illustrate the topic effectively is considered to be better than using no image at all It is important to understand that random recent depictions could be removed as undue in terms of notability while historical artwork in this case of the Late Medieval or Ottoman period adds significantly to the presentation of the history of how Muhammad was being topicalized throughout Muslim history It is important to understand that these depictions do not mean to present the face of Muhammad rather they present the person in the way the artist was more comfortable with and hold no immediate religious value on their own It is of particular interest that these means of portrayal generally convey one and only one aspect of a particular incident most commonly the event itself or maybe the act akin to the Western genre of history painting The depictions are thus not meant to have any accuracy to them and are presented here for what they are yet another form in which Muhammad was depicted As an analogy Jesus has been presented in a multitude of ways most of which are entirely inaccurate Jesus being according to tradition a Semite whereas he is generally depicted with distinctively Byzantine or Caucasian features None of these pictures are meant to hold a prominent place in the article as evident by their placement in the article nor are they meant as an assault to Islam It is also worth noting that several factions of Christianity oppose the use of hagiographic imagery which resulted even in hostilities but the images are still on Wikipedia exactly for what they are i e existing depictions of said people there is no unspoken insult intended Yours sincerely Bernard Dupre Wikipedia Disclaimer all mail to this address is answered by volunteers and responses are not to be considered an official statement of the Wikimedia Foundation For official correspondence please contact the Wikimedia Foundation by certified mail at the address listed on FROM SHIRAZ KIDWAI Dear Mr Dupre Thank you for your prompt reply My concern with the article is purely academic I am an architect and am researching to write about how the religious ideology of this man affected Islamic art and architecture I am therefore not concerned with pictures of the face of Muhammad as being an assault on Islam nor with a comparison with Christianity and hagiographic imagery I also did not understand analogizing of the biographical requirements of Jesus Homer Charlemagne and Muhammad Surely articles on each of these individuals would need to critically address the individual s biographical requirements rather than be written with a box standard strategy Given the way Wikipedia is able to seek the skills of editors from around the globe I did not expect such broad brushing as you suggested in Wikipedia s articles On the same note it also concerned me when you suggested that some parts of an article might be less prominent than others I have used Wikipedia since 2003 and I expect all parts of a Wikipedia articles to be pertinent and therefore equally prominent to the reader Notwithstanding my dissatisfaction with this article I must congratulate you as one of the editors for the overall high standards the Wikipedia is able to maintain I would agree with your suggestion that it is a good idea to use images that are historically significant artwork and or typical examples of popular depictions Perhaps not because it has become a longstanding tradition with Wikipedia but purely because such an image depiction would indeed aid in understanding the subject Having said that and having researched Islamic art and architecture for some time I wonder how one could conclude that the imagery used in this article is historically significant or is a typical example of popular depictions TYPICAL POPULAR DEPICTIONS The images used are most certainly not typical examples of popular depictions because the only thing popular about this man is that there are no nor have been any popular i e well known depictions of him As I have understood it it was part of his religious ideology not to allow depictions of animals or human beings and apparently he strongly advised his followers not make depictions of him during his life or after his death and indeed none were known to exist for hundreds of years after his death Perhaps that is why his followers have popularly not held and continue not to hold any images of him nor are were any popularly displayed in places of significance to his religion HISTORICALLY SIGNIFICANT The images certainly are historic however are they historically significant I don t think they are because even historically it was not common custom to depict Muhammad in paintings these paintings are therefore random sporadic historic depictions made hundreds of years after Muhammad s death contemporaneously much undue in notability in their times just as you have ascribed undue notability to random recent depictions of our times While the sporadic paintings were made in Muslim lands Muhammad was commonly not topicalized visually throughout Muslim history either due to popular tradition or as a religious icon or generally for theological academic reasons These images would therefore be historically considered as more of a diminutive variance rather than the norm Historic but not historically significant therefore What is historically MORE significant than these depictions Perhaps it is the deliberate conscious decision not to create a popular iconic or significant visual topicalization of this man This rather unique and biographically important fact is negated in the Wikipedia article which seems to suggest that this man s followers a vast majority of our civilisation sought religious imagery similar to popular western ideas of it Something that does not do justice to the wider universal worldview that I believe Wikipedia is designed to capture IDEOLOGY BIOGRAPHY An ideologue s ideology becomes intrinsic to his her biography In writing a biographical article about this man with these images the editors have entirely negated an important aspect of his ideology of not visually depicting animals and humans and not creating religious mythology around his image This ideology prevails dominantly in the religious art and architecture of his followers and should not go unstated and certainly not be negated in an article about him With these images this article misleads an uninitiated reader from understanding this unique aspect of the man s biography The reader begins to think that these depictions are how this man is was commonly recognized allowed himself to be depicted This is not the case Perhaps instead of these images and to aid the reader in critically understanding this man the article needs to state this man s rather unique and significant ideological requisite of not being visually depicted BIOGRAPHICAL IMAGERY One could say that the article is not for critically understanding this individual but is a mere objective biography of him But then both of us agree that there is no objectivity or biographical accuracy in these images How about a biography not having any image to illustrate the subject Especially when the subject of the biography positively disallowed such illustrations and when the only illustrations we have are factually inaccurate sporadic and not commonly recognized Perhaps their use in this particular case is abetting creating mythology where none exists instead for aiding an objective and or critical understanding of the subject As I have grown to understand it this is completely against the grain of Wikipedia which promotes articles with academic rigour factual accuracy and NO garnish Perhaps because we as western readers are so accustomed to associating portraits with an article about a person we fail to understand the significance and rational of not associating any image with a person thereby compromising our understanding of the subject I hope I have been reasonable in furthering this discussion fruitfully I look forward to your reply Yours sincerely Shiraz Kidwai FROM WIKIPEDIA Dear Shiraz Kidwai Thank you for your email If you have remarks on the content of the articles please put them on the discussion page associated with the article I m sorry but we here at the help desk really do not make editorial decisions we ll act in cases of libel copyright infringement and that s all Whether the article on the prophet of Islam should feature depictions of that person totally falls outside on the issues that we can deal with Yours sincerely Bernard Dupre Wikipedia Disclaimer all mail to this address is answered by

No content can be weighed in some cases The community felt this was one such case All people involved in the discussion were well versed in the ins and outs of process and deletion review Everyone had a chance to consider the processes And a consensus to keep the category deleted emerged I don t see any merit in restoring the category and repeating all the arguments again at wiki link It seemed clear that there was an even stronger consensus for seeing the thing deleted through process To me it seemed expedient to cut to the chase I think there was a consensus there to keep the category deleted I used my judgement and declared it I apologise if that seems like it was the wrong thing to do but it seemed like the right thing to do to me There was a consensus emergent and I just felt that energy spent further debating the issue would be better placed elsewhere I apologise that you feel I acted out of bounds All that said do you mind if I push off to bed now it s getting late I don t mean to appear rude but I m on UTC time,0

We do not put contentious credits in the lead sentence The writing credit is indicated in the 4th sentence of the lead section It should not be in both the 1st and 4th sentence especially when they are in conflict We reflect the credit we do not split it mentioning only one writer and then later a second one They go together The 4th sentence was my attempt to indicate there was something unusual but it would be WP UNDUE to go into it farther in the lead as Cameron has done very little to draw attention to this It s mentioned in the article where it belongs,0
As I said above I would suggest a rewrite of the removed section rather than a simple unrevert to restore the section in the form it had prior to its removal The rewrite need not necessarily feature the Civitas think tank source to which you objected as a primary source Instead it might assert that it has been posited that a culture of political correctness is responsible for damaging society by protecting some groups from having their stated views or in some cases their actions challenged I don t state that well I m not much of a wordsmith I described and linked four secondary sources above two which had been cited in the removed section and two others which I dug up which seem to me to support such an assertion It seems to me that such a subsection would fit well as a subsection into the Modern usage section as the current As a conspiracy theory and False accusations subsections My purpose here was not to champion the inclusion of such a subsection however It just seemed to me after the removal of the section had been called to my attention that the removal had been premature and I chimed in to say so and to invite more discussion about that earlier Boracay Bill,0

Here s the deleted content in case anyone s interested in actually making this page informative The Other Poems in Howl and Other Poems Though Howl was certainly Ginsberg s most famous poem the collection includes many examples of Ginsberg at his peak many of which garnered nearly as much attention and praise as Howl these include America a poem in a conversation form between the narrator and America When the narrator says It Occurs to me that I am America he follows with I am talking to myself again He s criticizing past events in the U S using a sarcastic tone His references to Communism are a sign of his sarcasm He refers to himself as a psychopath who s nearsighted by referring to himself as a psychopath he s criticizing America s lack of tolerance for change and differences as well as acknowledging that he sees the problems that are at hand He criticizes America saying they make a lot of changes abroad but they ignore the persistent issues here It was very radical for its time 1956 by discussing drugs sex mental issues He talks about being a Communist when he was seven after McCarthyism florished He references several heroes and martyrs of significant movements such as the labor movement These include Leon Trotsky the Scottsboro Boys Sacco and Vanzetti the Wobblies IWW Some of these were persecuted without evidence Despite the fact that he does not approve of all that is going on in America he is still an American and loves America A Supermarket in California a short poem about a dreamlike encounter with Walt Whitman about a hunger for collaboration or meeting with his idol The admiration is almost sexual food occasionally serving as sexual puns The poem suggests the stereotypical pattern of shopping for groceries and how Whitman went out of the norm Early in the poem he mentions tomatoes which is a fundamental fruit Later in the poem it says Whitman was tasting artichokes which is out of the ordinary Perhaps he was trying to show how Whitman was different from most of the fellow shoppers who stand in for people in general Whitman and Ginsberg steal some of the food He employs a different tone in this poem a calmer tone He references Frederico Garcia Lorca who wrote Surrealist poems about Walt Whitman Garcia Lorca could be stealing stuff too Sunflower Sutra an account of a sojourn with Jack Kerouac in a railroad yard the discovery of a sunflower covered in dirt and soot from the railroad yard and the subsequent revelation that this is a metaphor for all humanity we are not our skin of grime This relates to his vision auditory hallucination of poet William Blake reading Ah Sunflower Blake my visions See also line in Howl Blake light tragedies and references in other poems The theme of the poem is consistent with Ginsberg s revelation in his original vision of Blake the revelation that all of humanity was interconnected See also the line in Footnote to Howl The world is holy This may also be consistent with one reading of Ah Sunflower a soul on its way to heaven Transcription of Organ Music an account of a quiet moment in his new cottage in Berkley nearly empty not yet fully set up Ginsberg being too poor for example to get telephone service The poem contains repeated images of opening or being open open doors empty sockets opening flowers the open womb leading to the image of the whole world being open to receive The H P in the poem is Helen Parker one of Ginsberg s first girlfriends they dated briefly in 1950 The poem ends on a Whitman esque note with a confession of his desire for people to bow when they see him and say he is gifted with poetry and has seen the creator This may be seen as arrogance but Ginsberg s arrogant statements can often be read as tongue in cheek see for example I am America from America or the later poem Ego Confessions However this could be another example of Ginsberg trying on the Walt Whitman persona Whitman who for example called himself a kosmos partly to show the interconnectedness of all beings which would become so integral to his image in later decades In the Baggage Room at Grey Hound Some editions also include earlier poems such as Song In Back of the Real Wild Orphan An Asphodel,0

I was about to let it go tired and all but out of curiosity i wanted to check on your link So i clicked I was stuned by the fact it was possible to put such a long boggus link which show nothing but a forbiden page of a book in spanish Well it doesn t matter as i said before i am tired So from now on i will just add actual links some that are actually working to serious books or official website org and all from the scientific community university phd museum and all The first link goes to a french book by Pierre Darmangeat There is no data about the size of felidae but some interresting facts about tigers Origins cousins actual and prehistoric ones and more importantly geographic situations for all subspecies Pretty interesting but you gotta speak french The second link is to the portal IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group Cat Species a transcription of lennaeus manuscript 1758 and a passage from the 1981 Mazak Mazak V 1981 Mammalian Species Panthera tigris 152 1 8 Those are the average mesurements for all tiger subspecies crossed directly by observants phd Hermer Mazak and Herrington Linn e s data from Linnaeus 1758 is alson crossed There is nothing like exceptional features quote Tiger subspecies have been evaluated using both morphological and molecular methodologies Hemmer 1978b 1987 Maz k 1981 1983 Herrington 1987 Well there you can read Panthera Tigris Altaica males are going 2 7 to 3 3m long Same number you will find for all scientific description of the siberian tiger Note that i am here talking about pureblood subspecies Unlike the numbers usually given this is not the average size for the whole species wich counts that 8 subspecies Another link this time about lions Gir Forest and the saga of the Asiatic lion from Sudipta Mitra This book center on astiatic lions but there are many passage about other subspecies like at the page 108 there is a quick reference to panthera leo atrox and panthera leo leo barbary lion At the page 110 you will find mesurements about lions subspecies asiatic serengeti and north african one leo leo male and female You should love it nowadays most people don t make a difference betwen serengeti lions and others and just goes as if only the serengeti lion exists Oh my Ain t that what you are doing Another fun fact in this book page 109 i believe is giving a standart exemple of head body length mesure Another reference to it in the IUCN SSC web site It is called Basal Metabolic Rate it is the standart and it includes the Tail So maybe the size of the American Lion was taken from the birth of the tail to the nose but then it wouldn t be valid not official and finaly not acceptable for a scientific publication because off the standart So either it includes the tail and it s just the size of a big serengeti lion or else it s simply unreliable The size taken from the birth place of the tail is something done at a veterinary study for pets and almost to dogs only because sometimes their tail are cut The naturalist doesn t take the size the same way From the nose to the end of the tail on the back of the animal alongside the spine and to the number obtained is added the tail s size betwin parenthesis It is an international format and norm wich makes naturalism analysis a non vernacular method that all doc around the world can understand without having to speak the language of the observant Here is the Grzimek Encyclopedia of the mammals I could go on but with another 20links easy but i ll stop after this one and i hope you will go there because well this is a university link From the Michigan Zoology Museum and University ladies and gentlemen,0

Some practical considerations about mental arithmetic 1 The further the magnitude of your numbers is from 1 the more potential for error 2 The more people have to work with fractions rather than whole numbers the more potential for error 3 The more operations you require someone to make the more potential for error 4 The more constants that have to be remembered the more potential for error As a simple example let s suppose somebody wants to figure out the proportional volume change of his BCD as he goes from the surface to a depth of 30m useful for gauging what will happen to his buoyancy as he descends Using atm 10 metre rule depth 30 30 10 3 pressure 1 3 4 proportional volume of BCD 1 4 I m deliberately omitting units because that s how people generally conduct mental calculations regardless of scientific correctness The only constant that needs to be retrieved from memory is the 10 m 1 atm rule and that only once Under SI depth 30 Pressure 0 01 x 30 or alternately 30 100 either way we have to retrieve a constant from memory at this point 0 3 plus atmospheric pressure 0 1 retrieve a second constant from memory 0 4 so proportional volume 0 1 retrieve second constant again 0 4 1 4 Compare those two calculations At every step of the way the second is more prone to error 30 10 is easier than 30 100 or 0 01 x 30 1 3 is easier than 0 1 0 3 1 4 is easier than 0 1 0 4 The first calculation only requires one constant to be retrieved once the second requires two to be retrieved one of them twice For a scientist working at the surface with a calculator SI is wonderful It s rigorously defined it s scientifically correct etc etc As a professional scientist I insist on working in SI and the many who don t are a source of perpetual annoyance to me But when we re talking about non professionals performing mental calculations in an unfamiliar environment while undergoing physical exertion and quite possibly drunk from nitrogen narcosis the simpler method is to be favoured even if it makes it harder for them to tell a scientist what they ve done when they get home Should be avoided was a pretty mild way of putting it Maybe I should come up with some stronger language before I reinstate it So what Not everyone is a scientist As long as there are significant communities of people for whom atmosphere is a useful much used and well understood unit it s POV to call it should be avoided My wording could probably be cleaned up but making clear what the standards setters say does not violate NPOV If it did the mere classification into SI units and other units would also violate NPOV I would have absolutely no objection to noting that it s non SI and so should be avoided in scientific use But that objection applies equally to all units in the non SI section as such it should be stated at the beginning of the section clearly applying to all rather than as a note attached only to atm As it was that proscription was not stated with a context of in scientific use making it unjustifiably broad I notice also your failure to maintain the same laissez faire attitude towards grams force Or maybe that was just an oversight on your part I think you ve misread my edit there As much as I loathe grams force and such units they are at least a legitimate unit of force and thus grams force per cm 2 are a legitimate unit of pressure The edit referred specifically to grams per cm 2 not grams force and this usage is downright wrong Not because it s not SI but because it s not even dimensionally correct grams and grams force are not the same thing If you want to say that it s not an SI unit and use of atmosphere in scientific settings is therefore non desirable I see it used in engineering stuff all the time e g NASA spacecraft documentation I have no problem with that As to the grams force I have no idea what you re talking about Are you confusing me with someone else I mainly want to distinguish two different uses a standard atmosphere as a constant which is acceptable for use with SI versus a standard atmosphere as a unit of measure which is not Perhaps the standard model of the atmosphere not sure if that s the best name for this more involved concept needs to be distinguished as well Yes it was not you who took out my comment about atmospheres being unacceptable while not making a similar change to my comments about the g cm 2 units often seen as kg cm pressure gauges no longer being acceptable Curiously the same who took out my incorrect usage comment was the same one who inserted language about g cm saying that this usage is incorrect and should be avoided After I clarified this Calair left my statement untouched those formerly acceptable grams force are not a part of the modern SI and should be avoided That was however a more detailed explanation than my statement about the use of the atmosphere as a unit of measure so I concur in the need to revise my statement in that regard I left it untouched because it s a busy time of year and I got distracted Your statement does need to be clarified because the problem with g cm 2 is not that grams force aren t SI but that grams are not grams force the second half is correct but non sequitur My two edits are better seen as unrelated The point of the atm one was that although atms are not a SI unit of pressure there are occasions when non SI units are appropriate The point of the other was that g cm 2 are not a legitimate unit for pressure at all because g is not a unit of force I would not have made the same objection to grams force cm 2 I don t like those units at all but at least they re not outright wrong,0

It isn t my contention that Moore s law is the result of bad science Moore s law is the result of no science and a massive self propaganda campaign finding very fertile ground among a bunch of wishful thinking types Now the evidence for Moore s law is the result of bad science but evidence doesn t really figure in the popular education and dissemination of Moore s law What figures into it is bald stone cold mindless repetition Moore s law is more a subject for social science than economics As for the contention that I was attacking the belief that Moore s law was a natural physical law oh come on Could you have come up with a more credible red herring First of all Moore s law was originally proposed as an economic law and that s exactly how I treated it Now economic laws aren t inviolable but they re still supposed to be true as approximations Moore s law isn t even true as an approximation ie if you assume a constant exponential only as a generality And secondly it seems to me that people are quick to forget that empirical without any qualifiers is generally interpreted as meaning true Especially so when used in conjunction with observation and other scientific sounding terms So the empirical observation that blah blah tends to mean to most people that blah blah is a true fact The category of false empirical observations doesn t really register in people s minds unless it s explicitly pointed out with words such as false myth delusion illusion disproved unproved et cetera And then there are the really neutral ways of saying it like hypothesis theory conjecture claim statement et cetera Pick your poison I ll take any one You know these are really very standard words in science with very narrow highly codified meanings And empirical true fact of reality Oh yeah and the codified meaning of law is a concrete statement such as exactly 90 of everything is crap The correct code word for a generality such as Moore s law is is principle The Moore principle wouldn t have implied that there is a rigorous interpretation of it whereas the very name Moore s law implies that there is Since this is factually wrong Moore s law is simply false Well technically it s merely an oxymoron but being an oxymoron is a really bad thing to be for something that claims to be a Law Finally I don t think it s too much to ask of an introduction that it include the single word false in there somewhere I mean you ve got a whole phrase about who it s attributed to What s a single word on an infinitely more important aspect than the mistaken origins of Moore s law compared to an entire phrase,0

On the Film Talk page you wrote that I don t believe that Hana was going to Florence to be near Kip Let me explain how this is a perfect example of you having filled in the blanks which in WP speak is original research When Kip leaves the monastery he and Hana talk briefly about the future They both say they will always remember each other if they visit that church the one Kip showed her the frescoes in Hana says Maybe someday we ll meet again there Kip says And maybe we ll never see each other again When Hana is leaving days later she does not mention Kip nor does Caravaggio He introduces Hana to the village woman who will drive them and says she will take you as far as Florence That s it There is no plan made nor discussed the ending is completely open to interpretation You have inferred that she is going to meet Kip but not everyone does A few days ago on set as a result of our discussions here I asked a few people at lunch how they read the ending of this movie The 3 women there all thought the two would meet again maybe in Florence maybe someplace else but all said that was what happened because they wanted a happy ending Two men all thought that Kip would not survive much longer given his job and a third said they never meet again like me he had read the book and knew that they never do My point is this the ending is open ended and we can t draw our own conclusions and then state them here as a fact of plot It is a debatable endingeveryone has his her own idea If it happens in the film itself we can say it happened If it doesn t happen and isn t even discussed by the characters as a plan that might happen later we can t say this is why she s going to Florence Surely you can see that And clearly you have remembered the film s events out of order which is why you are insisting that the affair between K and A ends due to jealousy when in fact A s whole position during the affair is No ownership,0

I ll make it clear as to why the article should not be moved Firstly the editors who wish to move this article have a conflict of interest with Wikipedia policies See WP COI I recently requested a report on the editors and the article on violation of COI however the article got moved back The COI is clear as is the POV based interest in which several users have Having your own biased viewpoint that Goguryeo could be Chinese therefore this title is your own POV because there is already enough controversy on the issue and Goguryeo controversies and Template History of Manchuria were made to keep a NPOV here I m sure most readers know of the dispute between Korea and China Please read WP COI carefully before you quote it WP COI enumerates 1 Financial 2 Legal antagonists 3 Self promotion 4 Autobiography 5 Close relationships 6 Campaigning 7 Citing oneself 8 Promotional article production on behalf of clients None of these cases applies to an ordinary wikiuser For example you cannot challenge other wikiusers by saying they have financial or other motives to write wiki articles unless you have solid physical proofs Otherwise nobody is qualified to write wiki articles In addition I remember you always quote WP 3RR but failed to understand the meaning of WP 3RR and got blocked This reduces your credibility of quoting wikipolicies Second there is no long conflict or long standing dispute on this article as some editors try to make it There has been nothing majorly wrong with this article until users like Assault11 Naus and Wiki pokemon began to disrupt this and other Goguryeo related articles including the Template History of Manchuria which is another problem to fix My accusation for you has enough ground Your attitudes and biased edits are very clear and the fact that you have not been punished for personal attacks shows that you will be in trouble The title is logically inconsistent I asked the question why Silla is excluded in the wars As the alliance led by Silla destroyed Goguryeo and ended all Goguryeo related wars Silla can t be excluded Then I was told that Silla is included in the Goguryeo Silla Tang war section Then I asked the question does this mean Silla is part of China because of this funny title Then the funny thing is that you disappeared and now you appear again without answering the question I am also not pleased with how Komdori LactoseTI and Endroit simply turn away when this is going on You preach good faith NPOV and no personal attacks not to mention sprinkling tags all over the place as if they were limitless but when there is wrongdoing on your side you don t admonish them or warn them in an NPOV way Disgraceful in my opinion Back to my point POV editors ARE the ones who created this unstability Trying to destroy the credibility of this article by blowing tags all over the article and tagging sentences with dubious and unsourced on every singly sentence you don t like shows your biased viewpoint therefore making your arguments to be POV I don t understand why you have to tag the sentence Goguryeo fought with several Chinese dynasties as dubious So Goguryeo didn t fight Chinese dynasties Obvious facts don t need tags if you didn t know that Third Wikipedia is not a place to prove your point or whatever If the majority of the world agrees that Goguryeo was a Korean kingdom then thats that You can t try and force the Chinese viewpoint into Wikipedia Saying that the word Manchuria insults the Chinese people because of its supposed implication of Manchukuo is totally wrong here and although we may be sympathetic towards the Chinese no english users believe that Manchuria is offensive You keep emphasizing about China and the Chinese people s viewpoint but its not fair to other viewpoints Don t play word games The majority of the world doesn t say Goguryeo is Korean Instead look at the expressions what they say is that Goguryeo is an ancestral kingdom of Unified Silla Goryeo Joseon and Korea This doesn t mean they deny the fact that Goguryeo is also an ancestral kingdom of Mohe s Balhae Jurchen s Jin and Manchu s Qing The inheritance is not meant to be exclusive If you think historical facts are offensive to you it is your problem not the wikipedia s problem Fourth your reasons for the move is not solid enough The comments and discussions you make this also includes the Korean side is by making up your own arguments that Goguryeo is only Korean or arguing about some stuff about Mohe Jurchen Manchu and what ethnicity is what You are not here to try to prove something If you are then this is not the right place Agree this is not the right place for you to prove Goguryeo is only Korean I think you can never prove that here or somewhere else in the wikipedia Fifth there are other options for compromise For example you could make a separate category I m leaning into this I overlooked it in the latest poll but its a compromise we can agree on if the word China is such a pain to you which I still don t understand why Let me repeat again The title is logically inconsistent I asked the question why Silla is excluded in the wars As the alliance led by Silla destroyed Goguryeo and ended all Goguryeo related wars Silla can t be excluded Then I was told that Silla is included in the Goguryeo Silla Tang war section Then I asked the question does this mean Silla is part of China because of this funny title Then the funny thing is that you disappeared and now you appear again without answering the question Sixth the creation of the Template Military history of Goguryeo was not called for by both sides and saying that the template and title go hand in hand is invalid I find that this article was fine until it got disrupted and turned into an ugly article with all these tags I also believe that this is only the wish of a few editors who think that the Chinese viewpoint should be included in these discussions and in Wikipedia Without Wikipedia Reliable Sources and WP NPOV statements anything can be challenged in the wikipedia Please follow the rules Yes my speech is pretty long but if you fail to read it then I guess we can go back in the wheel of arguments,0

Let s try moving towards a least common denominator My point is that Romanian is a main designation legitimated by general use in Romanian English etc historiography while Danubian is a collateral naming Your point is that be it collateral or not Danubian is present in many historical works so that the wiki reader should be offered adequate information on what Danubian Principalities was Fine To sum it up I m pleading for the primacy of Romanian while you for the specificity of Danubian Let s put it together in an article called Romanian Principalities where a section make it as vast as you please will be Danubian Principalities concentrating on the specific historical period the term refers to Certainly Danubian Principalities should continue to be wikilinked to the events they are relevant to Such an entry Rom Princ should in the first instance clear why this term has been coined by historians There are not only ethno linguistic but first and foremost structural cultural and geo political reasons for this Let me mention in a rush but the Byzantine heritage which decisively shaped the two feudal countries Pointing out at the common ground which entitled historians to treat similarly Wallachia and Moldavia would then help to differentiate the Rom Princ from Transylvania where the Romanian demographic majority were not sufficient to qualify the feudal state as Romanian Thus I d rather concentrate on what makes a difference for the two feudal states to be treated together while leaving the details of factual history to the respective entries Wallachia and Moldavia These are so far my suggestions,0

You sound like a speaker for the Megali Idea I am sorry for not sharing the same beliefs and views on history I am just refering to forgotten history times like the reign of Heraclius the 7th century AC when the Greek became official language in the Eastern Roman Empire 50 years before him ruled an emperor born near my city which is in the region of Macedonia who didn t use Greek and his name was Justinian I Those were the non Greek Byzantine days but the Latin ones In the 7th century AC the Byzantine Empire also shrunk to the conquerings of the Slavs Avars and Arabs as well Macedonia could have not been very Greek then just when the Greek s Byzantine days begun Later it becames there and there part of the Eastern Roman Empire but it is hard to write Macedonia as Greek province or as Greek when the population was known to be dominantly Slavic speaking and even more it became a center of Slavic literacy Please stay objective The line that Macedonia was Greek or a Greek province in the Byzantine days is unsourced and a Greek POV part of the above mentioned XIX century ideology The edits can not be pro Macedonian because there is dominance of Greek editors on Wikipedia We are maybe 5 to 1 Everything that looks pro Macedonian is based on hard facts,0

You could ask our lawyer if he think it s a joke and is used to inflict censorship on the internet by intimidation Note that Godwin has not argued a Nazi Hitler comparison is never justified just that they are overused Also regardless of how it is used in the Middle East wars we aren t talking about them here and you were the one who brought up Nazism yet have not been able to explain why you feel it was somehow helpful to the discussion BTW I never said I was against censorship I m actually not in some circumstances However for better or worse wikipedia isn t censorsed which is generally taken to mean amongst other things we don t hide spoilers P S I made an extensive argument which you have not responded to other then to bring up Nazism again without explaining how exactly it fits at all into what I have saying Oh and of course also bringing up internal pages even though as I have already stated I didn t discuss internal pages nor did most people we are solely talking about the main page I also responded to your old point that seemed to suggest censorship was only evere practiced by the Nazi party it wasn t Finally I didn t bring up Godwin s law even though I was well aware of it and after it was brought up I pointed out it didn t really apply since you weren t accusing me of being a Nazi or comparing me to a Nazi Hitler but saying that I was somehow accusing you comparing you to the Nazi party even though I wasn t,0

I m not sure XTaran One the one hand rotary engine in the modern context almost always means Wankel rotary But then rotary engine in an avaition context almost always means the sort of thing you bolt on front of a Sopwith Camel On the other er on the third hand bracked disambiguation is always a thing to avoid unless it is impossible to come up with a sensible alternative What gets linked to most often What term is most natural for editors to use I think that there is no common interpretation on this This is what IIRC brought the whole discussion up Interesting is that the current page rotary engine lives under this name since 2001 so it seems a pretty common term On the other hand you are right Nowadays most people think of a wankel engine when hearing rotary engine This is what I called a historically grown error because the other type of engine seems to have the elder right to the name If you do go with a move and a disambiguation page then can I suggest that you avoid the ugly brackets in e g rotary engine piston engine by calling the pages reciprocating rotary engine and Wankel rotary engine The first one sounds fine it is unambiguous The second one makes me a little bit beely aching because the wankel engine is only the most popular type of that engine family but wankel neither was the first one building such engines nor is his invention a very generic example See for an impressive number of different implementation of zthis idea And the wankel engine page already exists and is fine What about something like wankel like rotary engine or wankel type rotary engine But there is no hurry Full ack As long as no one tries to merge this page with radial engine Although I start to believe that the guy who proposed this is nothing but a troll and I was so dumb and fed him Maybe we can see what some of the other engine and aircraft people think about this Yeah I really would like to hear some more ideas and opinions I just post mine to get feedback Maybe I won t be very responsive the next few days will be away for holidays in Austria,0
In my effort to merge the now deleted list from the article Gay icon to the Gay icons category I have added this page to the category I engaged in this effort as a human script adding everyone from the list to the category bypassing the fact checking stage That is what I am relying on you to do Please check the article Gay icon and make a judgment as to whether this person or group fits the category By distributing this task from the regular editors of one article to the regular editors of several articles I believe that the task of fact checking this information can be expedited Thank you very much,0

I simply want to add the events that took place on last night s episode After fleeing from Isaac s studio Peter goes to speak to Nathan and tells him of Simone s death Nathan suggests calling the police and begs Peter to stay so that he might help but Peter runs away again now feeling that anyone he cares about is in danger as long as he lives Peter stops by Mohinder s apartment to find it empty with papers and furniture astray as if a fight had taken place A few drops of blood fall on Peter s head and discovers Mohinder pinned to the ceiling whispering Sylar Peter turns around and Sylar has him cornered telekinetically pushing him into the wall I remember you You re like me aren t you I d like to see how that works Sylar begins to cut open Peter s forehead revealing the method by which Peter obtains his scar The episode ends as a couple of drops of blood and a lock of hair falls to the floor this was deleted earlier by Neil without any explanation or viable reason I just think that while this page is protected we don t forget to update this page as new episodes air Even though the page is protected we should remember to add details to Peter s bio as the show progresses,0

Where profits are involved one must be very careful about the claims by and on behalf of competing products We should not be implying that one product needs to be replaced with another Listing alternatives without saying why in that part of the article is thus a problem There have been many studies suggesting all sorts of things about butter and its competitors We can report what reliable sources say about it but cannot take a position on the matter Also if we imply that butter needs replacing because of alleged problems we really need to apply equivalent standards to the alternatives Potential problems have been found with at least some of the alternatives To just list alternatives thereby implying that butter is problematic without mentioning issues with the alternatives is unacceptable It would probably be going too far to list ALL the issues so I d suggest leaving the alternatives out,0

REPLACING taking the massive out of massively multiplayer Reason There is no indication that the definition of Massively multiplayer is not applicable What this means is that at times the action is non existent One could travel in game for literally hours and not find a worthwhile engagement Reason It can be proven by the amount of EWS that at least several dozen players are online at every regular game time Even the references which are just opinions by individuals do not support this statement REPLACING WITH However sufficient player concentrations can be consistently encountered due to the principle of using just a single game world instance and by introducing automated adjustment of gameplay hotspots based on player numbers see Attack and Defense Objectives,0
But the Manual of Style also says Wikipedia has established a manual of style to make reading easy by following a consistent format but the prescriptions of Wikipedia s manual of style are not binding Wikipedia does not require all editors to stick with only one single style or formatting It is not essential that there be consistency across everywhere in Wikipedia but consistency should be maintained internally within an article unless there are good reasons to vary also Articles that focus on a topic specific to a particular English speaking country should generally conform to the usage and spelling of that country and If an article is predominantly written in one type of English aim to conform to that type rather than provoking conflict by changing to another I think that it s fair to say the Manual of Style is amiguous on this point so we should go for whatever looks best for this page,0

This is a joke to me boy O the images that you kept there were still there becuase they have the name Gliese 581 c in the file name it makes no difference as anyone can name a photo with what ever name they like it s the same as adding the label to the gallery afterward Your point is usesless unless it is to get them all deleted The important point is that references that say this planet is definately not habitable have been used to support the false idea that it its habitable and these images simply depict the other possibilities The other month Dr Sara Seager wrote an article for Astronomy magazine on extrasolar planets in which she picked up on the term GasDwarf It s been used in science fiction for a while now but she is a scientist and she gave it validity once and for all so if I find a link online I will add it As for the rest look beyond the habitable delusion The file names don t prove anything either sport,0

You know I m not sure at first how to respond to that it may not have been your intent but it comes off as a wonderful bit of wikilawyering and acting as an apologist for the product However I m just going to assume I m reading that horrible wrong and deal with the issue raised Articles dealing with substances techniques inventions etc that make any sort of medical loosely interpreted claim are likely to fall under these guidelines Whether or not the FDA calls it a drug has little to nothing to do with how we treat articles on Wikipedia I m sure you re aware that the Wikipedia community has developed policies and guidelines over time that are believed to be best for the project few if any of these will have a basis in classification by government organizations or some other such real world advisory or supervisory committee On to what this means for the article I ve been working with a number of editors whose primary specialty on Wikipedia is scientific or medical articles and have gotten a crash course on this area of Wikipedia In reading through a few more of these related guidelines and seeing how articles are being handled elsewhere I ve become concerned over the strong use of primary research in the article I believe that statements drawn solely from primary research should be removed from the article in favor of sources that summarize or report on these studies And while we re discussing these issues its become apparent that while RhodeIslandRed tends to push against the product Tracey you have developed a push towards the product Please remember that Wikipedia isn t really the place for strong feelings or advocacy if you re not able to remain neutral on a subject and write for the enemy because of feelings about the subject or other editors involved its best to step back and take a break from the subject Also just because you can find a study that contradicts a general principle at Wikipedia doesn t mean that this overrides community consensus I m sure we could find a study to say just about anything we wanted if that were the case And this exact problem is why Wikipedia MEDRS is so important to this article use of sources which summarize and weight methods for us should be used instead of making those judgments ourselves,0
One other point should be made with regard to links There is a link to the Wikipedia article on the sphere This article on the sphere adequately covers the sphere surface radius and center We do not need additional links to the article on surfaces the article on radius or the article on centers The article on surfaces considers surfaces as a topological concept This serves more to distract and confuse the reader than for enlightenment Similar remarks could be made with regard to the articles on radius and center Therefore we need only the link to the sphere,0

To answer the question of it is quite clear that is one of those Jewish right wing extremists in Israel and the US who are making all efforts to smear Goldblum sometimes under several alterantive user names all for political rivalry They feel that Goldblum has such a solid Zionist background that can not be shaken so they try anything possible and present themselves as if they are neutral I will not be surprised if is one of those who were charged in the courts by Goldblum or close to one of them However there is no problem in bringing citations to all three issues that were raised himself was kind in bringing about a citation for the education part But he demands payment for that kindness by contesting Goldblum s military service and his participation in the 1973 war What exactly is the question about why is he so alarmed by the military service of Goldblum is that because it negates his attemtps to portray Goldblum as an enemy of the people and what is the request for citation about the personal life Is it required to scan a marriage certificate or is it just added in order to create a seemingly neutral nature of requests for citations so taht the military one and others that will emerge will seem to be neutral not motivated by extreme political rivalry of and his right wing allies My suggestion is to follow closely because he is a seriall vandalizer rastiniak,0

Although governments rarely publish examples of what they consider to be child pornography they sometimes provide detailed descriptions We find several of the Dost factors are met First the child is completely nude This satisfies the statutory requirement that the photograph depict a nude or partially nude minor Second for a child to appear in such a setting completely nude is clearly inappropriate Third the girl s weight is on one leg thereby emphasizing her genitalia Lastly the child who is looking into the camera is obviously posed for the photograph State of Utah v Raymond Dean Morrison Utah Supreme Court paragraph 21 The above description is for a photograph that cannot be published however the 4 parts of the ruling can be illustrated by the Pulitzer prize winning nude photograph of 9 year old Kim Phuc in a peculiar pain induced pose from injuries sustained during the Vietnam War The photo meets all 4 of the primary criteria used by the above court to determine whether an image is child pornography The child is nude The child is in a setting where nudity would not normally be expected The child s weight is on one leg The child is looking into the camera and thus appears posed However it should be noted that there are no known instances where the example photo has been officially considered child pornography,0

I have removed two sources from the article These are the books by Brian Massumi and Slavoj Zizek Both of these books enthusiastically refer to Deleuze s comment about buggery but they do not say it was famous hence they are not relevant In my view to support a claim that something was famous one needs a source that says this Using sources that do not explicitly say something was famous to support the claim that it was is probably a violation of the policy against original research which among other things says Material published by reliable sources can be put together in a way that constitutes original research Synthesizing material occurs when an editor comes to a conclusion by putting together different sources If the sources cited do not explicitly reach the same conclusion or if the sources cited are not directly related to the subject of the article then the editor is engaged in original research,0
Protecting a talk page where there was for the most part productive discussion on how to best apply policy to a move and there were no flamewars That s utterly amazing to me I ve never seen such a thing Sure locking down an article when there was protracted editwarring But protecting a talk page from civil discussion by the community Unbelievable,0

Marteau I m puzzled by this statement The material is well sourced and clearly quite relevant On what basis would you argue it needs to be excluded If nothing else remember that a given source may ordinarily be used for statements about itself and in this instance there s no identifiable third party so I m not seeing red flags In any event there is at least one additional source for it already listed at the top of this talk page,0
Hello I responded on your user page but I replicate part of the response here If the school itself used the term Alma Mater we should use Alma Mater If that is confusing we should possibly add a explanatory text like this Alma Mater University Anthem On your point that we should use common terms in English I agree with you in principle However let me remind you that the Chicago manual of style which is referred to is an American manual which differs with British English in some respects Furthermore if we backtrack a bit in the case of ROC Taiwan it seemed that common terms was strongly opposed from many quartes regardless of what people in the English speaking world actually call the government of that island In that debate it was argued that the commonly used term Taiwan was not advisable since the ROC did call itself Taiwan in its constitution Even the term ROC Taiwan was deemed inappropriate So if you want to be consistent it should be Alma Mater,0

6SJ7 it is a verifiable published fact that the UN has already acknowledged Palestine not Proposals for a Palestinian state as a political economic and legal entity see Non member States and Entities It is also a verifiable and published fact that same entity has been extended de jure recognition as a State by at least 67 other nations and de facto recognition by 50 or more other nations It was even recognized as a sovereign state in a ruling handed down by the District Court in Jerusalem until the Supreme Court decided it was a matter of political discretion and handed the question off to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs See J lem court Palestinian Authority meets criteria to be classed as a sovereign state Therefore it is a fact that one very NOTABLE meaning of the term Palestine is the existing political economic and legal entity known as the State of Palestine There is an existing article by that name which mentions that fact with appropriate references in the lede and Current status sections It also mentions the Proposals for a Palestinian state in line with the pre 1967 borders That information takes up about 6 or 7 lines in the entire article and about the same in the references section John Z the political entity has already been added under the term Palestine on the disambiguation page I have no objection to restoring a full length independent article with links and leaving a modest amount of information in the main article In the mean time the redirect to Proposals for a Palestinian state is definitely not appropriate since Palestine is the most easily recognized name,0

A filler is something that is used to take out time and will not forward the story in any way Such examples are when characters participate in something unrelated to the story such as when Naruto had to make ramen or when dedicate an entire episode to showing a character s background like Anko s flashbacks of her time with Orochimaru,0
i have no idea what you are talking about either i included everything in the 9 11 report having to do with saddam al qaeda links and the fact that it s now considered POV to directly quote the SSCI report is absurd to the point of being just plain silly as for the powell speech where has the CIA and DIA acknowledged that all those points have been totally discredited and don t simply say it s in the timeline give links and as for the as yet unreleased volume ii of the report you want me to quote a report that hasn t been released yet,0

For the ones that have actually filed and are listed at Candidate List I m not sure we need to even need to further consider whether any given filer is serious or not anyone who bothers filing for office statewide is probably not drunk at least any more than usual at the time As of tonight 2010 06 21 Monday after hours there are only 13 of them The threshold for including a candidate in an article about the election is much lower than for example the notability guidelines for having a separate article about one I don t know if filing means they ve qualified for the ballot already if they have their mere presence makes them significant to the election Even if not it s still a fairly small set I d say taking the time to file makes the likelihood of having an effect substantially more than that of the average person off the street,0

My view is that the content in question should be included because it is a succint summation of what Latham is arguing in his essay It is not POV because those are Latham s views Given that he is now a journalist commentator his views are also particularly relevant especially his views on the ALP since these are the views which attract the most attention In response to the argument that the onus lies with those seeking a departure from the status quo it was my original edit which was amended by having the last part taken out Therefore the onus would lie on those who have supported the last amendment Aust time,0
Sounds good to me too Though I must say I don t agree with the proposition that sustainability is the product of development of technologies I won t edit it back to how it was before now as we seem to have agreed on stopping tweaking but I d like to see it tweaked later on as sustainability certainly isn t a product of human advancement it s what human advancement is moving towards,0
You misunderstand me Chaldean I m not refering to Suroyo Suraya why would I do that I can show you sources where the Syriac people is mentioned as Syrian people About the Assyrians contra Assyrian people I have full understanding for that I was only showing that Syriacs is a searchable and not Assyrians And since Syriacs gets most hits it seems to me Syriacs is the most common name,0
I m heavily opposed to merging basically because these are decent articles even better than most album articles out there They are better than stubs so why should they be deleted and or merged So what if we can t get them to GA class or get a good topic or whatever I don t care about any of that personally I just want to create a comprehensive accurate guide to everything Slipknot on here They should have their own articles and if that stops us from getting Featured or Good topic status I quite frankly couldn t care that is no reason to merge these articles There is no reason why these articles should be removed,0

The bot is not really anything to do with the project and was started seperatly Also the bot is not intelligent so it does not know if the page is going to take month of sunday s to find a link to from the article space The bot is simple if it fits the criteria it will be tagged if it doesn t it will be untagged If you think there is a way in which the bot could improve that is practical then please suggest it on and I will be happy to implement it Any tag the bot adds is a fact it doesnt have any incomming links from articles there really is no dispute over this and really the tag should stay or it should be fixed Many articles become orphans then get links and then these links get removed or deleted If the bot were to keep track of a list of articles it had edited the bot would end up missing many articles There is a dispute over the use of the tags in the article space long conversations have gone on and in the end the tag stayed in the article space Again yes there is little thought for the tags as there does not need to be If links 1 then tag The tag is not to say that the article is broken but saying that it can be improved,0

No it s not The government of Taiwan took the name ROC but that does not mean it s the same state as this The territory controlled by this state is now controlled by Taiwan China and Mongolia Taiwan and China both claim to be the rightful successors to the whole of their joint territories Right now most of the world sides with China on this issue So no Taiwan the current ROC is not the same state as the ROC between 1912 49 To say so is to support Taiwan s claim and so is POV and not correct,0

It would still be syntactically correct for either meaning without on or by albeit less obviously so but that s beside the point As it stands now that sentence isn t great the actual quote being used is the borg and the rest is written in as intent Does that seem great to you I think we can tweak it up a bit I like the idea behind the sentence just not the execution of that thought if you know what I mean I don t have that audio commentary from The Making Of DVD so if you do any chance you can make that clearer and maybe somehow produce a better quote If you don t have it I can go rent it if necessary,0

Korea was a capitalist war North Korea invaded the South Algeria Was a colonial war Afghanistan I remember some soviet invasion at some point WWI and WWII Please Do not confuse imperialism WWI and Nazism WWII with capitalism Your claim that capitalism is associated with war is a complete fallacy Which wars were started by Sweden By the Netherlands By Canada As for the rest of your comment the wide spread poverty of the developing world whose consequence is hunger and lack of medical care among many other problems is certainly not due to capitalism in America and Europe How come Korea Japan Taiwan and now China managed to overcome poverty hunger and other problems Only because they embraced capitalism What you do not understand is that capitalism can only produce profits because it meets human needs i e because people buy what they think they need The problem in Africa for instance is that international trade is often very reduced because of high import duties preventing people from buying cereals and food in case there is a drought for instance,0
Orangemarlin Talk contribs m moved The eclipse of Darwinism to The eclipse of Darwin Unfortunately Darwinism is used in a historical context which might be confusing to the casual reader is it serious The Eclipse of Darwinism is a stable catch phrase nearly a meme It served as a book title already The lead paragraph should make it perfectly clear that the article deals with a historical phenomenon that s enough Darwinism is not in danger here,0

With regard to category 1 I assume you mean none of the scientists except the two who have quotes directly disagreeing with the statement that global warming is occurring No I said depending on how it is interpreted worded all scientists will either be in category 1 or none of them will Merlin once again why are you ignoring the fundamental problem of synthesis in a BLP The problem of category overlap simply shows that our original research is very sloppy The fundamental objection is you re not allowed to do original research in the first place,0
Silverback reverted humankind is performing a great geophysical experiment and if it turns out badly however that is defined we cannot undo it on the grounds of scaremongering There are three problems a its true there is no current way to remove atmos CO2 We cannot remove this forcing b its one of the arguments made so whether its scaremongering or not is irrelevant c its breaking the unstated convention that skeptics get to add what they want however nonsensical I might regard it to the skeptic side and err the other side add to the other side This is the only way to avoid edit wars over this page,0
I will read your comments above after this post while it s still fresh on my mind So I need to point out the two key errors 1 the way the article name and the info box stating Republic of China 1912 1949 indicates the state ENDED which is not true and 2 the map showing Taiwan as part of ROC is correct only for 4 yrs 1945 49 This is also why I proposed the merge Two key things are not factually correct To have an article with this title indicates a succession of states of ROC 1912 1949 ROC and PRC which is incorrect It is ROC ROC and PRC With a merged ROC article three maps can be shown in each main period 1912 1945 1945 49 1949 present that show the dramatic difference of territorial change And the merged article can just do without the geography section of mainland and refer to PRC article I think it s easier for readers to see the entire history of ROC in brief with the maps then they may be drawn to read the detailed history which then relate to the complex political status of Taiwan,0

The original spirit to give comment is mainly to improve articles in general Reviewers are not obliged to give their opinions as well or even come here to logon according to your way of ridiculous thinking Well something I didn t bring it up here is when the nominators bring back their articles to re nominate their improvement are sometimes contradicted to what they did This is the most laugable thing but I just feel sick of it That is why I don t support this way of nomination Contructive criticism is a vague term and debatable There is no strict guideline to scrutinize anyway You can basically do whatever you want,0

Noting the edit warring going on in the lede I have removed the disputed text because of an ambiguity problem Historically the NYT has been criticized for both liberal and conservative bias and for both a pro and anti Israel stance I thought about leaving the bit about ethical lapses in but I couldn t come up with a way of writing it that wouldn t sound dumb Certainly WP LEDE allows for major criticisms to be noted within reason but the fip flop position of the paper makes this quite complex I conclude it would be better of without it,0

The lead section should say the following or words to this effect The term agnosticism and the related agnostic were coined by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1869 As Huxley explains it agnosticism is not about knowledge at all because nobody can convince the world that he knows there is a god without producing logically satisfactory evidence of a god and nobody ever has According to Huxley agnostics are simply those who deny and repudiate any doctrine that there are propositions people ought to believe without logically satisfactory evidence This is one of the main issues that still remain concerning agnosticism The issue is whether there is anything distinctive in being agnostic When it comes right down to the facts of the matter theists in general do not generally say that they know that a god exists only that they believe there might be one and atheists in general do not say they know there is no god only that they do not believe there might be one And as Huxley points out in Agnosticism and Christianity agnosticism in essence is not really about knowledge at all since nobody knows it is about the denial and repudiation of any doctrine that there are propositions people ought to believe without logically satisfactory evidence Bright people who agree Those who are not bright and therefore do not agree,0

It does not suggest that The fact is that Channel 4 News editor Ben de Pear said that the station had called in security specialists in response to what he said were social media abuse and threats directed against her which is the point and focus of de Pear s reaction media reported the evidence as stated in The Observer or The Varsity Peterson teaching his followers that there s a difference between criticism and threats is out of context and less important to the section,0

An intelligence angle to the Levy investigation has never been reported by any major news organization Then it is non notable and has no place in this article Wikipedia is no place for slander or unsourced allegations particularly for a person who is not under investigation for the crime Your drawing a connection between his committee assignment and the affair is original research,0
Interesting I don t plan to say anything else there though no matter what happens next To be honest I feel a little sorry for Rodhullandemu and I think a line should be drawn under this incident asap to allow him to get on in peace with whatever it is that he intends to do At least until he does something like this again anyway although hopefully to someone else next time,0
There is no good way to handle an article like this The proposed edit unsuccessfully ran for adminship twice is classic cherry picking of factoids from a primary source even if WP RS were satisfied and should not occur I can understand that an editor might have reason to think that the information would be of interest to readers but imagine if I were to make a user subpage with links to discussions where an editor failed to get support such a page would be deleted per WP POLEMIC More to the point if no secondary source has written an analysis of discussions involving the subject we should not do so either,0

Difficult to know where to start Take the very first paragraph for instance with that well worn claim by the California Fish and Game Department that there were 800 000 pet ferrets in the USA by 1996 It s often challenged and is very likely complete nonsense Also why the emphasis given to Wendy Winstead and her celebrity friends And do you really believe that ferrets have a repertoire of behaviors both endearing and difficult for some human owners is an appropriately neutral tone for an encyclopedia article,0

Response to Don t reconfigure my talk entry to put your response in before my question To answer your question about why the sources are promotional have you seen WP ELNO and WP ELYES Having a very few links is superior to having a long list About the sources themselves I think the articles that are in magazines and news should be used as references to support article text or not used at all The youtube videos are too rah rah The presidential inauguration played a recording of the musicians over the massive extended sound system and over the airwaves as it was too cold for their instruments to sound good As it stands the video is a play acted out by very skilled musicians trying not to cringe as they listen to each others s out of tune instruments The ArkivMusic link was my mistake I didn t realize it is now a Steinway brand,0

Yes I see your point and the point misses the point Under the rules of Wikipedia the FBI is considered a reliable source Your job as a Wikipedia editor is not to double check a source to make sure it isn t self publishing whatever it deems necessary to achieve its agenda Government agencies have been putting out falsehoods for as long as there have been government agencies And people in government agencies may have agendas which may make them biased The fact that a source such as the FBI may have an agenda or may be biased or may be self publishing whatever it deems necessary is not a valid objection for to the use of that source in Wikipedia In Wikipedia sources are allowed to be biased and Wikipedia does not exclude biased sources merely because they are biased Please review the Wikipedia guidelines on Relaible Sources and in particular the Wikipedia rules on Neutral Point of View Yours,0
When Ceres was discovered in 1801 At first everyone was like Oh it definently a planet It s right where we excpected it to be In the huge empty gap between Mars and Jupiter And it was obvious Sure the best telescopes couldn t resolved it as anything more then a point of light but that s ok And everyone was happy Until Pallas was discovered Well that s ok We ll have another planet And then came Juno And another After some time they eventually realised that thousands of these odd Asteroids would be found and that they couldn t fit in well with the big planets known at the time Mercury to Neptune So then the planet count went back down to 8 Until Pluto was discovered Pretty much the same thing happened it was definently a planet although an oddball too Until 1992 Something else was found beyond Neptune It was smaller but it was in the same area Doubt lingered but then along came some others Sedna Quaoar and then X We face the same problem today We know that out there is something like an asteroid belt but with ice instead of rock Perhaps X and Pluto would just be really big comets in the Kuiper Belt Maybe if something is mostly made of ice it can t be a planet because if brought close to the Sun it vanishes pretty quickly It would look nice sure in it s death pangs but when all is said and done the system I thought they d choose wouldn t have an arbitrary barrier at 800 km for size but at say Mercury It s made of rock round big is very close to the Sun but still not vaporised Seems logical to me But what do I know I m not one in the commitee of 7 elderly astronomers who decide the faith of the Sol system When we discovered about say 50 of these things just Nuke and Pave the bloated list with Mercury being the smallest,0

I think it will take a pretty substantial rewrite In my view the news coverage of this issue has tended to the extremes either the cost overruns are entirely Adams fault or they are something he entirely inherited To achieve an NPOV will require some careful research and careful writing I don t personally have the time to do that any time soon I note it more as a general goal for the future or in the hopes that somebody gets to it before I do Make sense,0

Standing is a common surname The fact that the name itself is hyperlinked should prevent confusion Humor is often used as a way to entertain but also to inform No this is not a comedy encyclopedia but so long as the image is relevant to and does not disrupt the article there s no need for it to be taken down If someone cracks a smile while reading the article how is that a bad thing It s simply an image of a person sitting taken at another angle The camera angle isn t ideal here no but the placement of the man sitting in a chair accompanied by a multitude of empty chairs a common instrument used for sitting should make it sufficient for placement There is no need for the Standing sitting image to be taken down,0

I agree with Bastun I support option 1 it makes sense to have an article on the British Isles a term known and used by many despite certain peoples claims it should cover all periods of history within the British Isles if we make this to sovereign states then it complicates matters Option two is unacceptable a better article already exists as mentioned by Bastun and thats currently where British Military history redirects to 3 would be a reasonable compromise that id accept its certainly alot better than the current inaccurate title On 4 i would support articles at those locations but whats the content going to be Currently this is just a list of different articles an article at Military history of Britain and Military history of Ireland would be a good idea but it should talk through all the stages in history like Military history of Europe does otherwise a large part will simply be two identical lists This should just remain a list of all the conflicts of the British Isles or Britain and Ireland and the introduction could link to separate articles on Britain Ireland if someone wanted to make them Also another problem is at some stage someone may want to create a Military history of Ireland about the actual country Anyway i support option one but id accept option 3 if it led to consensus,0
Yes any new user who starts editing these articles in a similar pattern or uses similar rhetoric right from the beginning is Samuel Luo or maybe Tomananda even though he did seem intelligent enough to not sink into that level That will hold true at least until Samuel has verifiably stopped using sockpuppets See Wikipedia sockpuppets of Samuel Luo and Suspected Wikipedia sockpuppets of Samuel Luo Sorry but Samuel Luo pretty much poisoned the well for any new editors who try to represent his viewpoints,0
Oh did i now Your false accusements continue against me and so do your nationalist provocations Again that source was on even be4 i got to wikipedia but nvm that it would be a good idea to put that source in or as for that we can put a source of up to 1 million people of Serbian origin in the U S as a higher estimation i wouldnt have anything against just make it reliable Largest Serbian diaspora lives in Usa and Germany this is why we need a higher estimation for the U S where undoubtebly live atleast up to 1 million ppl of Serbian origin Let me give you an example and comparison with Norwegians at the end of 19th century there was about 17 000 Norwegians living in the U S and about 20 000 Montenegrin Serbs alone Today number of people with Norwegian ancestry is 5 million How many ppl of Serbian origin then I find these sources okay and if neccesary you can input even a figure from Tim Judah s book,0

Proposal made by Several naming proposals have been made unfortunately while some are outright false List of tallest buildings and structures in Paris others inaccurate List of tallest buildings and structures in the Paris region The common practise and general concensus of list naming dictates that list be named after a geographical region The move discussion should be based upon if the list should be based on solely the City commune of Paris or the outlying region le de France In light of the list s content the only appropriate choice of naming which obeys the current convention is List of tallest buildings and structures in le de France This not only cleary states what is described by the list offers no interpretation no disambiguation and permits the creation of further list such as List of tallest buildings and structures in Haute Normandie or List of tallest buildings and structures in Limousin instead of List of tallest buildings and structures in the Limoges region In the event of the creation of a category the newly named list will find its place in Category Lists of tallest buildings and structures in France itself in Category Lists of tallest buildings or Category Lists of structures Please fill in your opinions on this propose naming scheme bearing in mind it s in full compliance with naming conventions and is stricto facto correct Support Well I would wouldn t I,0

A minor point the picture is down at the bottom of the page so people have to scroll down to see it which may be a suitable compromise for such debatable articles And besides any display of popular magazines at the newsagent store checkout is likely to have at least one image that far worse and which will be on display for a week and the forthcoming commemoration of WWI is likely to produce a range of books with potentially disturbing covers likely to be on display for far longer There will always be a debate on where the boundaries for what should appear on the MP or eg a certain other well known website lie,0

Velvet elvis81 in his comment shows the lack of understanding he she has in so many other ridiculous edits he makes This is where he is wrong Sorry VE but Wikipedia style is not the primary consideration Being factually correct and in the case of this article demonstrating the reality of the article subject is what matters Otherwise Wikipedia is a joke comments like Velvet Elvis are a prime example of why Wikipedia remains a joke and is not allowed as a reference in academic papers In the case of the Church of Christ article sorry sir madam but reality of the entity that the article attempts to represent is primary Until folks like you understand that Wiki is worthless Preceding unsigned comment added by,1
That definitely is a reliable source However given the resistance below to naming Jeremiah Heaton I m slightly reluctant to add Hamdy s name as well Anybody have a suggestion for a succinct way to incorporate this now that we have a WP RS,0
I know those kind of references aren t the best ones but they are the ones that have been used The text on those year articles is a summary of text on other articles from having checked the What links here section for each page So Wikipedia articles that link to this article is actually a very accurate description of where the information has been found,0
Sorry I was using my pompous tone normally reserved for pages like Talk Cold fusion I know your edits are well intentioned However I don t think it is reasonable for editors to choose information such as an RfA that did not succeed or a barnstar that was awarded as of encyclopedic significance Highlighting something that did not succeed in particular is problematic because the clear implication is that there was some defect when we know that there can be many complex issues regarding RfAs issues that would need a secondary source to show context,0

No I did address you request in my edit summary when I removed the original research what I said was the burden of proof lies with the person who wishes to include information in the article and that since the material had been challenged it must be removed until a source was found for it That is still the case it is how Wiki operates What you said was you didn t think Wiki operated this way and that you were free to include anything you thought of as fact without a reference and it was up to the challenger to provide a reason for removing it And that is not Wiki You have removed some of the weasel words that were in the section well done that is a start What you have left is a disparate set of facts which you have joined together using your own understanding of the situation without providing a source to say that understanding is valid Of note are particular phrases you use like Of note is followed by nary a reference to say why it might be of note Nor do you think you need one it seems since you say that since it is of note it can be automatically included without a reference since it is common knowledge Your attitude of ownership is not conducive to the betterment of the article and is likely to be brought to attention,0

Now I m not certain about this but what we ve been saying in NSWRFL foundation clubs about them being founded in 1908 might be completely wrong I thought that the foundation NSWRFL clubs already existed as rugby union clubs and simply broke away from the Union much like clubs in the north of England like Wigan did Wigan s foundation year is not 1895 the year they broke away to form the RFL it is many years before that when they were members of the already existing RFU We have all the NSWRFL foundation clubs histories starting from 1908 as though they suddenly sprung out of the ground then with no mention of the pre schism years I might be wrong Maybe a second Eastern Suburbs RL club existed alongside the first Eastern Suburbs RU club but I just have a feeling the Australian situation mirrored the English one more closely and that this has been overlooked,0
Thank you Yes I have requested a translation My Italian is not good However having listened to this recording a number of times it appears to me that what Pedretti is saying is either I am very cautious very cautious about attributing this work with authority or This work is cautious very cautious when compared with authorised works Please tell me which of these two translations in correct It is clear that he regards the work as significant that he supports the detailed scientific study of works such as this that may throw light on his subject that he is rather embarrassed by the situation in which he has been placed and will not be trapped into stating that he personally attributes the work to Leonardo,0

Then add to the article rather than deleting things This removal is bad because it specifies the size of real world vehicles which are otherwise not mentioned Do launch vehicles usually launch a kilogram a tonne a thousand tonnes a million tonnes The article doesn t otherwise say Although I agree that it s based on a single source it s still a reliable source The article is clearly worse without it than with it It s always much easier to remove stuff from articles for quibbles like these Good articles are general informative and you re doing the opposite making it less informative for what seem to me to be quite pedantic reasons,0
The discussion about the existence of both articles have gone on for long enough at both their GANs and AfDs and most recently at Wikipedia Featured topic candidates Slipknot discography I say we just merge them both into this article once and for all Otherwise we can t move on with an ultimate Slipknot topic at some point in the future To merge them both in a lot of stuff will have to be removed but a lot of it is redundant with what s in here I recall talking about this with who might be able to shed some more light on the situation,0

I think Doc you are making things up as you go along to be honest If you recall I asked if you could use one of the reviews which is independent from the drug companies you declined to use that review probably because it didn t suit your POV and because it used the dreaded word toxicity to describe adverse effects My edits today to the adverse effects of fluoroquinolones for the most part were fixing misrepresentation of the citations gross misinterpretations of what the citations meant I dunno whether you did that intentionally or perhaps because English is your 2nd language you have difficulty interpreting the literature I have not been doing any original research I have just spent a good 2 weeks deleting a lot of original research made by other editors I am getting rather annoyed with your false accusations of changing the evidence when infact that is exactly what you did and I corrected you several times today I have also been correcting the David and the other editors mistakes as well I should get a medal for the work I have done in correcting errors removing original research if anything Why are you telling me all of this I have spent the past 2 weeks telling other editors to use citations if they don t agree with the stats The only people misrepresenting stats here has been yourself and newcomer editors If you recall the whole of the past 2 weeks I have been removing case reports original research etc etc I said that I believe that I had gotten most of it out I am not superman You cannot expect me to have a 100 accurate article after only 10 days or so work on it Reading over 150 citations in 10 days is a lot to ask for I will fix the brain damage section but for goodness sake give a guy a chance So nit picking one or two outstanding edits which I did not even make is really uncalled for I really don t understand why you seem to be attacking me both openly and subtly My goodness dude 90 or so of the problems you raised on the talk page I agreed with and deleted or amended case reports original research misrepresentation Heck dude 4 or 5 people voted for Fluoroquinolone toxicity to be the page but guess what I sided with YOU and merged into the adverse effects article If anything I have been bending rules over ruling other people when I am not even an admin but yet you still thing I am terribly biased against you LOL You were using case reports as epidemiology stats for goodness sake you were doing exactly what David did when he came on wiki as a newcomer My only gripe with you is misrepresentation of citations which I edited and fixed and bias selection of sources All I did today was fix errors and add in a new review which is not by the drug companies I am proud of my edits I am proud of getting rid of original research misuse of case reports correcting errors etc I have no clue why on earth you are accusing me of these things for I did nothing wrong but improve the article and tried to strive towards neutrality You can say what you like I feel that you are starting to get personal with me and my temper is getting short,0

Fairly regularly someone seems to add this template to an article simply because you might think the title would be capitalized in the middle of a sentence but it s not That s not correct The template should be used only for titles that would appear in lower case even at the beginning of a sentence the title of an article being analogous to the beginning of a sentence Any suggestions as to how to publicize this I considered adding an HTML comment to the text of the template itself but given that it isn t subst d it s unlikely that the right people would actually see the comment,0

It is broadly accepted in non theological archaeological circles for example that there is no evidence of Jesus period Do you mean there is no archaeological evidence for Jesus No there isn t and there is no reason why there should be If you mean there is no evidence of Jesus at all exactly the opposite is true Graeme Clarke Emeritus Professor of Classical Ancient History and Archaeology at Australian National University has stated Frankly I know of no ancient historian or biblical historian who would have a twinge of doubt about the existence of a Jesus Christ the documentary evidence is simply overwhelming Co director of Ancient Cultures Research Centre at Macquarie University Sydney Australia Alanna Nobbs has stated While historical and theological debates remain about the actions and significance of this figure his fame as a teacher and his crucifixion under the Roman prefect Pontius Pilate may be described as historically certain For instance they are historians There is no debate among historians about Jesus existence,0

PBS is correct in stating there are other disputes in this article The copying of source material and the potential for legal trouble that it caused was merely the most immediate concern Other concerns include the use of subjective and biased language in the article including section headings that refer to wide interests and early death the idea of the subject of the article as a pioneer in a field where according to the cited source his main technical contribution was to annoy the creator of the process so much that he devised an effective way to keep the subject out of his laboratory and the use of citation templates in the citations which are mostly objected to as change for the sake of change despite providing more information about the source including in at least one instance links to articles on the authors Discussion of these concerns especially as to how they relate to the policies and guidelines of Wikipedia would be welcome,0

Of course discussion from you here is welcome Better to actually discuss than run to Jimbo s talk page and complain about how did you put it Oh yeah a singularly difficult editor which raises one of a number of issues I ve seen discussed in the past year or so but never acted on I e how to handle bad editors see here That in the vein of WP NPA and WP AGF along with your edit warring behavior plagiarism and copyvios Doesn t look to good at all,0
I commented out the material about the ArbCom case because it s a self published source which is never allowed in BLPs unless the author publisher is the subject of the bio Do we have a source for his qualifications The article implies that both his degrees are from Oxford but is that right If so the first one is unlikely to be a B A I ve changed it to M A in the infobox but we need to check it,0
EDIT Looked at the archived source you referred to it s a joke First off it never even claimed that nu metal revival and nu metalcore Rather they proposed nu metalcore and new nu metal a term no one else uses except in a literal sense as possible names for a subset of the nu metal revival with certain qualities but they actually divided that group of new bands into two categories those that metalcore based and those that are nu metal based also they list old bands as being part of the rival contrary to your claims just not as part of nu metalcore or new nu metal for obvious reasons Second their use of the terms was prescriptivist while Wikipedia is a descriptivist resource Unless we are referring to a specific guy s work which we aren t multiple people need to actually use the term for it to be a legitimate alternative Finally it s an extremely low quality source it clearly went down for a reason and it should never have been added to Wikipedia in the first place as it does not reach quality standards It s just a random person s blog who no one else referred to someone just put it on Wikipedia as a quickly dirty way to add a new genre as frankly the way new edits is enforced is very poor people pay more attention to whether a link exists or not than what the link actually is too I guess you could use multiple blog sources to prove it is a way people use a term but it would take MULTIPLE sources not just one and again the article was making grossly inaccurate claims about how people refer to nu metalcore bands and then using it to make grossly inaccurate claims about what bands constitute nu metalcore,0

Oppose On GBooks I found 7 post 1980 English language examples for banh bo 1 for b nh b So googling doesn t resolve this one The Vietnam related articles are predominantly at ASCII titles now See Category Vietnamese people Category Cities in Vietnam or feature articles like Thich Quang Duc Nguyen Chanh Thi and arrest and assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem There are certainly other food titles such as pho that are currently at ASCII titles as well So if we take consistency seriously this title should stay where it is Britannica and National Geographic have the most diacritic friendly policies among major English language publications but neither uses Vietnamese diacritics Lonely Planet and the other travel guides give native script names for every language you can think of but not for Vietnamese Vietnam s English language press is the only place where I found any mention of this type of food in English and that is without diacritics See VietnamNet Bridge or Viet Nam News Follow the general usage in reliable sources that are written in the English language per WP DIACRITICS A title that includes Vietnamese diacritics misleads the reader into thinking that these marks are in used in mainstream English language publications which is not the case,0
Which crap That your removal of material that has been untouched for 7 months is reverted In that case I suggest reading the first several sentences at Wikipedia CONSENSUS Reaching consensus through editing Material that has been untouched for months has implicit consensus You made an edit it was reverted Thats how it goes The sudden removal of sourced content by Mr Nice Guy falls under WP vandalism No it doesnt,0

I know that the letter of appointment is published as section 1 of The Revelations of James J Strang here I assume that means they view it as scripture I see what you are saying about the word forgery but I don t think using the term here implies criminal fraudulent activity in most people s minds Strang very well could be guilty of a criminal act I don t know but the sources were concerned mainly with the document s authenticity rather than Strang s state of mind If the anonymous editor has any other suggestions for a word other than forgery s he ought to propose something,0
Yes Oxford online gives the galvanized iron meaning with the qualifier that it is used chiefly in the term G I can It also gives the Government or General Issue meaning under a separate definition I don t think one is the descendant of the other I think they had coincedentally identical abbreviations i e they are two separate terms with different etymologies,0
Whoa whoa whoa You re making a huge leap in saying They merely list it under that category because they realize some ppl label them that is blatant original research The fact is that the site clearly says Christian rock as the category I have never NOT acknowledged that the site lists other elements that their genres draw from again a band can encompass multiple genres No need to be so bitter,0
Well the first thing that strikes me is that those all lived half a millennium or more earlier than Jesus was supposed to so one would naturally have difficulty in establishing the historicity of anyone from that era Comparison with a contemporary such as Caesar Augustus would be more appropriate and such a comparison instantly shows what a wealth of detailed records of the time are available from the Romans records and the likes of Plutarch Josephus and Philo of Alexandria who was in fact a contemporary of Jesus but never mentioned him in his writings The earlier pagan personages you mention were still better recorded than Jesus and as there do not appear to have been any subsequent attempts made to alter these figures from ones of civil and military renown into supernatural deities there is less reason to doubt a record that states that such and such person ruled at such and such a time They all have equal or more credible historical credentials than the two possibly three brief references in historical documents that establish Jesus existence but they don t require more as there are no extraordinary claims made on their behalf such as they rose from the dead or are god Would it matter if Cylon of Athens was discovered to be purely mythical And really getting back to the original point does anyone beyond a few scholars actually regard them to be proven historical figures And as I intimated would anyone actually care much either way,0

Bishen Bedi is the only one who makes stupid comments like that And if you didn t know Michael Holding has back tracked and agreed with the ICC findings Your hunch that they thing he chucks is a pretty lame argument I m fine with both Murali and Warne having one of instead of the Dude I am not saying that he chucks I m saying that many guys don t rate him because they think he does chuck even though they won t say that they think that he does That doesn t change the fact that many people don t think he is the best irrelevant of what their internal reasoning As for people like Holding or Gilchrist or anybody else nobody will say they think that he chucks even though they think he does chuck because they don t want to be fined by the ICC All these surveys of Australian cricketers show that they think MacGill is the second best spinner in the world after Warne Obviously either they are extremely biased or they don t consider Murali to be legit It s obvious they think that he chucks,1

I like most of it except for the part where they aren t described as professing or claiming to be Christian Also the word orthodoxy is just slightly ambiguous Can we develop orthodoxy into something that more clearly indicates mainstream Christianity I thought about orthodox Christianity but that could be interpreted to mean the Eastern Orthodox Church Another possibility is the orthodoxy of Catholic Protestant and Eastern Orthodox Churches I m not sure about the phrase restored primitive Christianity Does this mean the same thing as a restoration of the primitive Christian church I assume that you intend it to mean the same thing I m not sure that it does Also I m not fond of the phrase religious body What is a religious body I will comment that the Eastern Orthodox Church is described as a Christian body and I don t like that phrasing much either I know this phrasing does not necessarily originate with Marvin Otherwise I like the rest of it,0

The substance and quality of BLPs are negatively affected by the introduction of material that is sourced to attack websites or partisan smear publications The BLP policy is designed to prevent that Many people don t like that aspect of the policy because it prevents them from using the encyclopedia to attack living individuals Those who are trying to improve the encyclopedia and the substance and quality of its articles understand the need for high quality reliable sources that are compliant with this policy,0

I don t know exactly what the deal is with SeattleTimes com maybe they count how many times a IP address shows up So try a different coffee shop I m pretty certain the dates on the Seattle Times articles are correct to some degree The caveat is that the publication date on the web page sometimes differs from the print edition and possibly even between city and suburban rural editions as an item that misses the deadline for one edition may be carried over to the next day I have also found one article that was printed on the 26th then republished on the web on April 9th as annotated So maybe this something we try to do reasonably well and not get hung up in the gears Good question Without seeing a transcript of the press conference it s hard to say exactly what he meant Given the general tone and drift of remarks coming from the county I d guess that this is on the line of completely unforseen It is interesting to note that the some of geologists e g Dave Montgomery while not at all surprised that there was a slide at that site are expressing some surprise at how far it ran out and even how fast I suspect this results from how a mudslide differs from a landslide Where the glacioalluvial sediments of the bluff collapsed it was indeed a landslide But where all of that including the ground water water in the river and topsoil got mixed together with a good amount of air it was definitely a mud flow I expect that at some point the county will try to deflect the charges of you should have known that slides there are common by conflating it with the scientists didn t know how far the slide would go Then we might see some attempts to re interpret this and similar remarks,0

Ok I think we need to roll this back and take it from the top Tempers are flaring including mine over what should be a simple matter and for my part I apologize I realize I m not exactly the easiest person to deal with but let s try to clear the air and resolve this And for what it s worth it s not just us this entire discussion has already taken place once So why don t we try to lay things out and decide once and for all I think part of the problem is we ve lost sight of the underlying issue namely the importance of easy understanding vs accuracy Nobody here disputes that there are a myriad of terms which can refer to the tuatara reptile amniote diapsid basal diapsid sphenodont Sauropsid etc I further think that we ve resolved the issue of paraphyly being a problem we re using ITIS classification and reptilia sauropsida is recognized in both ITIS and the scientific literature regardless of the paraphyletic nature of the clade This IMHO leaves only the issue of communication Which term is best for the intro Personally I favor reptile for the following reasons 1 It s clear and understandable to most readers 2 Other potentially less clear terms would either confuse the reader or have them click the link which while accurate would disrupt the reading of the introductory sentence To me that seems like a rather serious impediment to readability 3 Other terms do not contain any more information They are either taxonomically equivalent or nearly so 4 Further details on the animal and it s exact phylogeny are laid out in the next section Ok let s try to resolve this thing without killing each other What term do you favor why do you think it s preferable and what impact will it have on the article regarding clarity accuracy and information content especially considering that this is an introductory sentence,0

I agree that the document contained sic no policy recommendations about Iraq This is not disputed What is disputed is whether many if indeed any report claims that there are policy recommendations about Iraq in the document as alleged by the clause contrary to many reports which misleads the reader into thinking that the critics criticism is that the document contains policy recommendations about iraq which is a blatent politically motivated distortion that is simply not true 00 56 2004 Aug 5 UTC,0

Actually it matters a great deal This is after all supposed to be an encyclopedia article on military slang not a mere definition list To be more precise this is not a concordance of all slang that happens to be used by the military This list was created to describe slang terms which are either unique to the military or which can be verifiably shown to have originated with the military It must meet one of those two criteria or it has no place in the list No one disputes that the phrase dead in the water is used by the military We even used the term in the Army But it s also in wide use outside the military and has been for a very long time The military is made up of people who came from all walks of life They bring their language with them into the service Slang that happens to be used by military people is not synonymous with military slang Of course the other inclusion criteria is slang which originated with the military before moving out to wider usage Unfortunately I know of no reference demonstrating that dead in the water originated as a military slang phrase Until someone can cite a reliable source that this phrase originated with the military it is inappropriate for this list By the way a corcordance of all slang used by the military would be an interesting list However the proper place for such concordances is an appendix in Wiktionary Perhaps this list should be transwiki d there so it can be expanded as you suggest,0

To pre empt any complaints that the EuroGamer source discusses twinking in the context of WOW I fail to see how twinking in WOW the most popular MMO will be any different to other MMOs If it is indeed different then as the most popular MMO its definition needs to be covered in equal proportion to Everquest which is what Koster mainly makes reference to I am fine with a caveat in World of Warcraft being added to the sentence however Furthermore there is little point in adding it to the WOW section because that section should not even be there for the reasons discussed above This article is unlikely to ever consist of more than a few sentences of verifiable content so it s rather futile to move anything into the article body as it were,0

I am not familiar with the circumstances under which you make your comment and I do not doubt that they are very much valid However I would like to point out that the expansiveness of an article does not and should not correlate with the present day salience of its topic especially if the topic is controversial or political in nature Rather all encyclopedic articles ought to be inclusive of information whose substance is germane for incorporation and exclusive of information that is arbitrary slanted peripheral excessive or otherwise unsuitable for inclusion,0

The concept of a puppy mill still seems really generic Either a list or a set of parameters that show what is and is not a puppy mill would be really helpful Unless the term is generic by definition Some online definitions Puppy mills are breeding facilities that produce purebred puppies in large numbers The documented problems of puppy mills include over breeding inbreeding minimal veterinary care poor quality food and shelter lack of socialization with humans overcrowded cages and the killing of unwanted animals The U S federal Animal Welfare Act does not define the term puppy mill Connecticut state law does not define the term puppy mill but has the following requirements requires the licensing of certain breeding kennels authorizes the agriculture commissioner to inspect kennels and order the correction of unsanitary and other unsatisfactory conditions imposes fines and prison terms on noncompliant kennel owners and keepers and prohibits the sale of puppies younger than eight weeks old Puppy mills are facilities which are licensed by the United States Department of Agriculture that mass produce puppies for pet stores throughout the country and to emerging foreign markets,0

The Supreme Court cases usually refer to Korematsu Hirabayashi and Yasui although Endo is also a case At any rate the intial comment but the court upheld the government s right to intern is still wrong even if the writer was talking about Endo Now that we re getting into the semantics of free to leave or incarcerated in concentration camps this is a good opportunity to clarify The government made a rule that any person wishing to enter or leave a Relocation Center had to petition to do so The reason for the petition was two fold One reason was to ensure the individual was not a security risk and was loyal to the United States The second reason was to ensure the individual had to the means to support himeself outside the military zones The WRA set up offices in the large cities outside the military zones to aid evacuees in finding employment and housing So if arrangements had not been made by March 25 1942 to settle outside the military zones you were going to a Relocation Center People started leaving the centers on June of 1942 WRA An Evacuated People 1946 You will also find in the Endo ruling which provides a nice concise history of the evacuation if you read the entire thing the reason why Mitsue Endo was not released sooner It had nothing to do with the government questioning her loyalty Endo had failed to provide the WRA with the proper paperwork when petitioning for her leave clearance The Endo case states Original copy is all capitals THE PROGRAM OF THE WAR RELOCATION AUTHORITY IS SAID TO HAVE THREE MAIN FEATURES 1 THE MAINTENANCE OF RELOCATION CENTERS AS INTERIM PLACES OF RESIDENCE FOR EVACUEES 2 THE SEGREGATION OF LOYAL FROM DISLOYAL EVACUEES 3 THE CONTINUED DETENTION OF THE DISLOYAL AND SO FAR AS POSSIBLE THE RELOCATION OF THE LOYAL IN SELECTED COMMUNITIES FN7 IN CONNECTION WITH THE LATTER PHASE OF ITS WORK THE WAR RELOCATION AUTHORITY ESTABLISHED A PROCEDURE FOR OBTAINING LEAVE FROM RELOCATION CENTERS THAT PROCEDURE SO FAR AS INDEFINITE LEAVE FN8 IS CONCERNED PRESENTLY PROVIDES FN9 AS FOLLOWS APPLICATION FOR LEAVE CLEARANCE IS REQUIRED AN INVESTIGATION OF THE APPLICANT IS MADE FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASCERTAINING THE PROBABLE EFFECT UPON THE WAR PROGRAM AND UPON THE PUBLIC PEACE AND SECURITY OF ISSUING INDEFINITE LEAVE TO THE APPLICANT FN10 THE GRANT OF LEAVE CLEARANCE DOES NOT AUTHORIZE DEPARTURE FROM THE RELOCATION CENTER APPLICATION FOR INDEFINITE LEAVE MUST ALSO BE MADE INDEFINITE LEAVE MAY BE GRANTED UNDER 14 SPECIFIED CONDITIONS FN11 FOR EXAMPLE IT MAY BE GRANTED 1 WHERE THE APPLICANT PROPOSES TO ACCEPT AN EMPLOYMENT OFFER OR AN OFFER OF SUPPORT THAT HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED AND APPROVED BY THE AUTHORITY OR 2 WHERE THE APPLICANT DOES NOT INTEND TO WORK BUT HAS ADEQUATE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF AND A RELOCATION OFFICER HAS INVESTIGATED AND APPROVED PUBLIC SENTIMENT AT HIS PROPOSED DESTINATION OR 3 WHERE THE APPLICANT HAS MADE ARRANGEMENTS TO LIVE AT A HOTEL OR IN A PRIVATE HOME APPROVED BY A RELOCATION OFFICER WHILE ARRANGING FOR EMPLOYMENT OR 4 WHERE THE APPLICANT PROPOSES TO ACCEPT EMPLOYMENT BY A FEDERAL OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY OR 5 WHERE THE APPLICANT IS GOING TO LIVE WITH DESIGNATED CLASSES OF RELATIVES Endo case also states MITSUYE ENDO MADE APPLICATION FOR LEAVE CLEARANCE ON FEBRUARY 19 1943 AFTER THE PETITION WAS FILED IN THE DISTRICT COURT LEAVE CLEARANCE FN15 WAS GRANTED HER ON AUGUST 16 1943 BUT SHE MADE NO APPLICATION FOR INDEFINITE LEAVE FN16 So that s why Endo wasn t released She didn t petition for indefinate leave It should also be noted that petitions for entry into a Relcoation Center were also required Once an individual was granted leave the WRA wouldn t just let them return They had to have a good reason for doing so Certainly the folks at Wikipedia can understand the importance of keeping a program orderly and adhering to the rules Regards History Student,0

Since there seems to be no argument against the reliability of the citation I am concluding that the opposition to its inclusion here is based on irrational name calling directed at the scientists who wrote it The JOTM paper surveys research in the area under study and recommends that there is justification for further research You seem to be saying that Orthomolecular medicine lacks a research basis but oppose Wikipedia reporting here that a peer reviewed journal has published a paper stating this and concluding that more research is necessary,0

I ll ask a question instead of answering What nations or regions do you think need to be linked to help someone understand the Krampus The guideline states that unless a term is particularly relevant to the context in the article the following are not usually linked It then goes on to discuss various categories that can be easily overlinked So to honour that concept which nation or region needs to be linked I ll come at the question from a different direction as well What is the likelihood that a reader is going to come to this article by thinking what s the nation in south central Europe You know the one During the Christmas season they have that Krampus thing I know I ll check the Wikipedia article because it ll be listed there and I can click through to the article on the nation I ll come at the question from yet one other direction If a reader comes to this article either by a specific search of the term or by clicking through one of the approximately 500 articles that are linked to it and say to themselves I know nothing about Austria Bavaria Croatia Czech Republic Hungary Northern Italy including South Tyrol Slovakia or Slovenia which of them should I click through to first to learn about it Remembering that they re linked in the opening paragraph Remembering that we don t want to create a WP SEAOFBLUE I await your response If the questions are not answered this will likely be the only comment I make on the subject While you deliberate I ll comment for the record that I d be fine deleting Bavaria and Northern Italy but South Tyrol is sufficiently obscure that it probably should remain linked but for consistency could see its removal as well The process that I used to determine what should and should not be linked was a script that de links only physical countries,0

Rarely can there have been a less Pyrric victory The Persian army was annhilated Alexander captured the enemy capital and carried on campaigning for another 7 years I think Pyrrus himself would have been a lot happier if he could have won some battles like this This was a decisive victory no matter what the cost in lives since it finished off the Persian resistance And the Persian capital was captured That is about as decisive as it gets It is quite adequately pointed out in the infobox already that Macedonian losses were heavy This is why I have changed the result to Decisive Macedonian Victory which is standard wording I realise that this will annoy some Persio philes out there so I would like to point out that a I am not Greek and that b I have previously changed the result of Battle of Thermopylae to Decisive Persian Victory because that is what it was I have no bias towards either side but the facts are the facts,0

Right your last sentence is certainly true and I suggest including it But have you had a look at Haftsin in Iranica where the author observes that Fourthly some peoples who share in the heritage of Iranian culture and tradition e g the Afghans Tajiks Armenians do not prepare it Even more remarkable is the fact that it is not customary among the Kurds Honari pp 132 33 or the Zoroastrians Boyce Stronghold p 168 n 10 zargo asp p 247 both ardent preservers of ancient Iranian traditions for whom the heptad does play a central role It is noted however by Nikn m p 32 that nowadays the haft sin is prepared for the Nowruz table in many Zoroastrian families particularly those living in cities This is clearly a new trend influenced by increased contact with other Iranians Interestingly the Kurds bake the samani cake for the feast of Kose geldi Bois p 477 see FESTIVALS V KURDISH So concerning Haft Sin it might be the case I know that one day long Samanu making tradition is particular to Afghanistan and Tajikistan and not shared by most of people of Iran,0

My entry was removed by the originator of the current text changed from The BCA eventually dropped the case after a ruling on the meaning of Singh s article went against them to referencing the guardian as saying In 2010 after 2 years the BCA dropped the case after the court of the appeal found that Singh was expressing opinion rather than stating facts The presiding judges commented that this litigation has almost certainly had a chilling effect on public debate which might otherwise have assisted potential patients to make informed choices about the possible use of chiropractic This entry is implicating that the Guardian and other pseudoscience rejecting media saw this as only a technical win for Singh or even worse and no implication whatsoever on the BCA practices besides opinion Actually the article explicitly and carefully pointed out that his claims where upheld by other bodies and that this was a victory for Singh The tone and the content are in fact embracing Singh s words in the book which is the prominent mainstream view Since Wikipedia has a clear policy about pseudoscience WP Fringe which states and significant minority views published in reliable sources should be represented fairly and proportionately editors should be careful not to present the pseudoscientific fringe views alongside the scientific or academic consensus as though they are opposing but still equal views While pseudoscience may in some cases be significant to an article it should not obfuscate the description or prominence of the mainstream views Please return my edit which added The Guardian noted that Singh had been sued because he had spoken out against chiropractors for making claims the Advertising Standards Authority has ruled can no longer be made Otherwise the article is promoting chiropractics a trait clearly marked in the Wikipedia and with no doubt as pseudoscience,0

A You would need reliable sources to verify that claim which would likely be difficult to find because B that s not true Emo originated from the Washington D C hardcore punk movement of the early mid 1980s Numerous sources support this and it s detailed in the article In recent years a number of bands have been tagged with the emo label who have gothic influences in their music and or style such as My Chemical Romance Alkaline Trio Aiden etc but this does not mean that emo is blatantly based on the gothic rock movement Historically there has been almost no similarity between emo and goth either in music or style until the early 2000s and even then only in the sense of some of the bands wear black use eyeliner and sometimes sing about dark topics,0
This edit seem problematic on several levels In a minor way it is the heading Roman Catholicism which bears no relation to the subject discussed and apparent liberal quotes from the supplied source which should be paraphrases for copyright reasons But the larger issue is whether it belongs at all in the article To my reading it seems to run afoul of WP FRINGE and WP DUE Searching the web for various terms therein I was able to find this forum post a Masonic reading in the Catholic Encyclopedia and this mostly unrelated blog post Not reliable sources and nothing to suggest that these myths or stories are a part of mainstream scholarship on the titulus WP FRINGE states An idea that is not broadly supported by scholarship in its field must not be given undue weight in an article about a mainstream idea and reliable sources must be cited that affirm the relationship of the marginal idea to the mainstream idea in a serious and substantial manner Now Easton Press appears to be a luxury book imprint and their catalog seems to be reprints of popular and notable works I am sure that Robert Graves work is a reliable source I am just not sure that it represents anywhere near mainstream scholarship on this topic or we would be able to find myriad other sources to support addition of this section,0

If you check the policy on original research you will see that argumentation that serves to advance a position is indeed forbidden We are at most compilers of other peoples opinions We are not here to state our own opinions We can draw trivial inferences but nothing beyond that To your other point the Brut Tysilio as it currently exists that is as a Welsh document could indeed have been GoM s source since he only claims the book was in Welsh and the Welsh book is certainly in Welsh In addition although the current version is called the Brut Tysilio that does not change the fact that it s a translation When you do a translation you don t change it s name A German version of the Bible is still called the Bible The mere fact that we have only the last version of the Brut doesn t change the issue of what GoM s source was If he used the original Welsh version or the doubly translated version also in Welsh he still used the Brut Tysilio,0

The only reason the IFA had a long history of representing Ireland was because it was founded first The FAI has an equally strong claim and was supported by FIFA To claim the British Home Championship was the most prestigious tournament at the time is an extremely British centric POV It was just one of several similar regional competitions and is only notable because it is the oldest While the home nations chose the path of isolation other countries including the Irish Free State were competing in the Olympic Games and the World Cup Unlike the BHC these two competitions are still going strong Yes the FAI did face accusations of selecting third rate Northerners in an attempt to strengthen their case However the IFA and English FA regularly blocked FAI attempts to call up Northern Ireland and England based players and the article cites some examples I don t see how this makes this team claims to be all Ireland less valid The team regularly included Northern players their ability or lack of it is irrelevant In addition the make up of the team is also more relevant then which team was most popular The FAI only picked Irish League players for Iberia tour this is true However equally the IFA never picked a League of Ireland based player after 1924 all Free State born players who were selected for IFA were based in UK Both associations are guilty of blocking players from their own leagues from playing for their rivals However this still does not make their claims to be all Ireland teams less valid Your version of the FIFA ruling is still wooly and open to misunderstanding Removed below Bad spelling bad grammar and just incorrect It also just repeats info already included in article elsewhere Last sentence in second excerpt is also misleading when FIFA decreded that the team be known as The republic of Ireland and that the only football team permitted to use the name Ireland was the Irish FA international selection The Irish FA successfully appealed the decision and were allowed to retain the right to field a team called Ireland with players drawn throughout Ireland in the non FIFA regulated British Home Championship however a Republic born player was never to play for Ireland again,0

That the caste system existed in the ancient world is not disputed even by the likes of Zwart What the contemporary people are saying is that the British administrative efforts driven often by Brahmin urgings served to intensify the significance of caste in a modern context to reinforce boundaries within the system etc and thus made it more rigid There was a certain amount of fluidity in the pre British system whereby people s caste roles were redefined That for example is why there are so many degraded kshatriyas Or so the postcolonialists say This view is not what the lead reflects With regard to its origin to the uninitiated caste is thought of as an ancient fact of Hindu life and is the result of the British colonial regime I have mentioned it earlier as well It is the first sentence on the origins of caste system in the lead and it directly comes to Colonialism as if there has been no time period such as ancient and pre British India I assume the article is not only about the caste system in Colonial and post colonial India Further the lead has 5 references to affirmative action based on caste which I believe is POV pushing PS How do I cite sources and request for a rewrite Here in talk page AB,0

I have found a link to the full Pryce Jones article and updated the link on Bibliography for Harold Pinter Many people have heard or read the Bermant quote and it would be peculiar if it couldn t be found on Wikipedia except on a Talk page or deep in some reference It might fit in a chapter discussing Pinter s politics his critics etc I m not familiar enough with his work to go further but a quote that wicked would probably interest casual readers of the article A possible qualifying source might be the blog entry by one Miriam Shaviv who says she is Bermant s daughter in law She provides the quote as belonging to Chaim Bermant It is here The Steyn quote is the lesser of the two and probably could be skipped But I was interested in your use of the word progressive National Review has a definite conservative bias and generally derides progressive writers and thinkers It s surely POV when uncapitalized and historically incorrect if capitalized You used the term absurdist earlier which may be more fitting,0

How to describe polling To my mind we already have more than enough information about poll numbers and what we have is jumbled out of context and not terribly helpful for the biography These sentences added just moments ago are intended in all good faith but I think it only compounds the problem Verifiability and reliable sources do not seem to be the problem I ll accept that the numbers are correct and well sourced Rather there are just too many numbers there is no particular context or reason to include some but not others or some dates and not others and they are out of sequence Right now we have First 100 days Jan April 2009 59 to 69 August to November note 4 month gap no reason given why any of these dates are significant 53 dropped below 50 for first time in November note no justification why 50 is anything special or just number gazing Pew Research February 63 December 49 note backing up to February and extending into December so not connected to other dates Comparable to Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton comparable in what way and what difference does it make Not comparable to George Bush because George Bush was popular due to 9 11 so what This is an article about Obama I really don t think the month by month numbers are of any use nor are poll numbers just for the sake of having poll numbers When poll numbers respond to events of the day that doesn t add anything either because that s just what poll numbers do If we re going to have popularity polls at all I think we can do with one or two sentences something like Obama s approval rating which started out at a relatively strong x for the first few months of his presidency declined through the first year and hit a low of 49 in December which many commentators attributed to X and Y We can figure out what X and Y are but they seem to be a combination of normal tendency of presidential popularity to wane after elections as the reality of a new president sets in the particularly high expectations and some disillusionment with Obama not meeting them the stubbornness of the recession and or the health care reform and opposition to it That explanation will be very hard to get right and without bias because there are so many factors and it is subject to so much opinion speculation and politicking Further this is going to change every month or two so we would have to rewrite the paragraph on a near constant basis because adding a new sentence every month won t work Perhaps we should just leave the explanation off or say that it was attributed to a number of factors and link to several good sources on what those factors might be Any ideas,0

The definition of socialism ought to be in an article on socialism not here At any rate would feudalism or mercantilism be socialism Because neither of these was laissez faire capitalism Furthermore is the mixed economy of the U S today laissez faire capitalism I think this definition ultimately leads to just about every economic system ever applied anywhere as being socialism This definition is utterly unacceptable I think from any reasonable standpoint But this is an argument for the socialism page which is linked to in this article At any rate I ve redone my changed article to try to make it somewhat less POV I d welcome any further changes you d like to make so that it can adequately express your viewpoints,0

The lead section should say the following or words to this effect The term agnosticism and the related agnostic were coined by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1869 As Huxley explains it agnosticism is not about knowledge at all because nobody can convince the world that he knows there is a god without producing logically satisfactory evidence of a god and nobody ever has According to Huxley agnostics are simply those who deny and repudiate any doctrine that there are propositions people ought to believe without logically satisfactory evidence This is one of the main issues that still remain concerning agnosticism The issue is whether there is anything distinctive in being agnostic When it comes right down to the facts of the matter theists in general do not generally say that they know that a god exists only that they believe there might be one and atheists in general do not say they know there is no god only that they do not believe there might be one And as Huxley points out in Agnosticism and Christianity agnosticism in essence is not really about knowledge at all since nobody knows it is about the denial and repudiation of any doctrine that there are propositions people ought to believe without logically satisfactory evidence Bright people who agree Those who are not bright and therefore do not agree,0

Here we go again Okay my solution Both comments go out The first comment doesn t build anything concrete the article it only enforces rumors and speculations Second comment does that as well Wikipedia does not want these trivial comments as a matter of fact It s better for both comments to be removed and wait for a more concrete and more relevant statement As for my stand Remove both comments,0
The North Vietnamese did not agreed to all of the US s war aims In contrast the U S government was forced to recognised the defacto rule of the National Liberation Front in several regions of South Vietnam that were captured during the 1972 offensive and approximately 150 000 North Vietnamese soldiers were allowed to stay in those areas under the provisions of the Paris agreement Thus the Americans had to pick up and run whereas the North Vietnamese stayed where they were In fact the U S government was so desperate to retreat from Vietnam that they completely disregarded South Vietnam s objection to the Paris agreement which South Vietnamese leaders believed was their regime s death warrant Behind the scenes Nixon even promised to pay war reparations if North Vietnam signed the Paris agreement which never materialised due to the Watergate Scandal To sum it up the North Vietnamese benefited much more from the Paris agreement because U S military forces retreated from Vietnam with their tails between their legs with nothing to show after more than a decade of military intervention,0

Your arguments are based on misconceptions misinterpretations and at times deliberate denial of fact Take for example the bit above about the Cosmological Principle being unfalsifiable Even after both Art Carlson and I clearly stated why you were wrong you persisted as though you had some understanding of the Cosmological Principle that was eluding us despite the fact that you know far less cosmology as demonstrated by the few attempts you have made to argue in the subject Now you are at it with reference frames and coordinate systems which it seems you still have a hard time wrapping your mind around because you balked at the suggestion that someone could use a reference frame to describe a coordinate system or at least claimed that I said we weren t permitted to talk about reference frames If you want to remain in a state of argumentative ignorance be my guest but don t go accusing me thenb of being closeminded,0

The Marlon Brando vs Olivier juxtaposition is a gross and dated oversimplification yet an unflattering comparison to Brando is present THEY ARE NOTHING ALIKE Olivier was an esteemed stage actor capable of portraying every role there is Brando was an esteemed film actor who became more of an icon than an actor and was consistently typecast Olivier was classical and Brando was method Dogma permeates this comparison and doesn t hold up to scrutiny We should talk about Olivier not others,0

While population transfers were effected in the Assyrian Babylonian and Persian periods most of the indigenous population remained in place Moreover after Jerusalem was destroyed in AD 70 the population by and large remained in situ and did so again after Bar Kochba s revolt in AD 135 When the vast majority of the population became Christian during the Byzantine period no vast number were driven out and similarly in the seventh century when the vast majority became Muslim few were driven from the land Palestine has been multi cultural and multi ethnic from the beginning as one can read between the lines even in the biblical narrative Many Palestinian Jews became Christians and in turn Muslims Ironically many of the forebears of Palestinian Arab refugees may well have been Jewish Michael Prior theologian Michael Prior Zionism and the State of Israel A Moral Inquiry Psychology Press 1999 p 201 Another person whose main credentials seem to be being an anti Zionist What makes him RS for this,0

Who said it was impossible to absolutely synchronize clocks SR rules out such synchronization in frames moving with respect to each other but Einstein went to lengths to show how two clocks in the same frame can be synchronized and define what it meant for them to be synchronized This is done as follows Starting with two good clocks atomic clocks ideal clocks what have you in their crates if you d like one is chosen to act as a clock for the starting point and set and this clock will be called A The other to be called B is moved to the desired location of the second clock at a known distance away from the first clock This distance can be determined by laying out rulers keeping careful track of the motion of the clock to ascertain how far it has travelled or any other method Then a signal is sent from clock A to clock B containing the time at clock A Obviously as this signal takes time to reach clock B depending upon the method used to send it One could use the second postulate and use a light signal to send the information but it is equally acceptable to have someone walk it over or any other method where the speed can be well known for instance via Doppler shift to keep track However sent the velocity and known distance are used to correct the time from clock A to account for passed time I should stress that time dialation or length contraction do not enter into the issue as both the speed and distance are obtained from the stationary frame of the clocks Clock B is set to the correct time thus calculated This setting can be checked between the two clocks but we ll assume that the clock setters don t screw it up the first time or that the process is suitably automated Then it would be necessary to check that the two clocks are indeed synchronized so clock A sends a signal to clock B let s say containing the time it was sent then clock B sends a signal back to clock A and clock A sends one last signal to clock B Assume that there is zero turnaround time or that turnaround time is suitably accounted for Call the times at which the signals were sent and Then according to Einstein s synchronization procedure the clocks are synchronized if This is how one synchronizes two clocks in the same frame So then verifying the second postulate becomes simple Exchanging light signals between the two synchronized clocks will do the job Sending a signal from clock A to clock B with the time it was sent from clock A contained therein or sent along later Then the speed of light can be determined from knowing the distance between the clocks determined during the synchronization process and the time it took for the signal to propogate Similarly the round trip speed of light can be confirmed from Einstein s synchronization condition That is Moreover the condition that is a proof for the isotropy of light speed From these confirmations the second postulate that light is always propagated in empty space with a definite velocity c which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body can be confirmed and used to show that the speed of light is always just the speed of light As to Maxwell it is correct that his equations were known earlier than either Michelson Morley or Einstein and that knowledge of Maxwell s equations did not and does not automatically imply the second postulate Indeed the fact that the speed of light or more correctly the speed of EM waves which is what light is did not depend upon any facet of any observer or frame was interpreted as evidence for the aether The aether would be the frame in which the speed of light was as in Maxwell s equations However as history shows the aether hypothesis ran into a great deal of trouble What Einstein did particularly in his first postulate was propose that Maxwell s equations like Newton s laws were the same for all observers in inertial frames So in every inertial frame the result of the equations that EM waves and light would travel at the speed of light should need to hold true Otherwise the first postulate could not be correct as it would be possible to tell two inertial frames moving with respect to each other from each other by testing Maxwell s equations testing the strength of the electric and magnetic interactions and even measuring the speed of light As to testing these predictions and the second postulate it should be pointed out that SR is in fact not strictly true It was superseded by General Relativity which complicates the picture We live in the middle of a gravitational field which is not uniform So there is a limit to the size of our laboratory for making a test Now I m far to lazy to look it up or do any calculations but it may very well be that the laboratory length required to fully test the second postulate is too large to accomodate the assumption of an inertial frame So if the second postulate has not been adequately tested it may be due to these restrictions and to restrictions in our ability to conduct such experiments I hope this has satisfied most people,0

There have been many editors here including those you have mentioned but also others who have remarked upon the negative nature of this article some of them have concluded that your edits are to a greater or lesser extent responsible for this state of affairs The use of we to which you attach unwarranted significance was intended to include their voices here There was even an investigation into your behaviour on WP Your uncalled for remark about my being a de facto voice for other editors tells more about you than you realise as did your recent remark about the pro Juice Plus lobby tacit admission it would appear that you see yourself in the anti Juice Plus camp I do wish that you would stop criticising other editors as being SPAs as you once were before you took the advice of an admin to look about for other articles you could edit sock meat puppets COI etc This is simply an unfounded smear tactic possibly intended to distract from the arguments about the content So once again 1 the paragraph of the article under discussion is about the effect of various Juice Plus regimens on folate and homocysteine 2 the Samman et al study reports an 8 4 decrease in homocysteine a undisputed reliable source which you think you have the right to amend 3 since the paragraph is about the change in homocysteine levels it is necessary to reflect the authors stated explanation that this percentage decrease is low due to the high folate level in the subjects at baseline Very simple 4 Omitting this explanation would leave the reader with a false impression Since I must still assume good faith on your part and also that you do wish the article to be accurate I must also assume that you have not understood this point Now that it has I hope been clarified perhaps we can move on If not perhaps we should ask or to have a look and perhaps initiate another independent peer review to get the article back on track again Is that the course you wish to follow,0

3O Response Ok first off I can tell that both of you mean well I think Chase s edits were a well intentioned effort to improve the lede I think Tomical s reaction on this talk page has been a little hostile but at the same time he is understandably trying to hold this article to featured article standards I agree with Chase that the lede was a little long with some awkward wording For example Single Ladies Put a Ring on It is a song from Beyonc s third album I Am Sasha Fierce 2008 is an improvement over Single Ladies Put a Ring on It is a song recorded by American singer Beyonc from her third studio album I Am Sasha Fierce 2008 Both those sentences convey the same information however the first one does it in a more concise and accessible style avoiding the passive voice However not all the changes Chase made are equally beneficial I thought I saw at least one place where Chase s version condensed by making use of contractions which are generally to be avoided in formal writing including encyclopedias See MOS CONTRACTION However I can t find it now so maybe I was wrong One place where Chase s version falls short is this sentence The song written by Christopher Tricky Stewart Terius The Dream Nash Thaddis Kuk Harrell and Beyonc was inspired by her 2008 marriage to Jay Z and discusses men s unwillingness to commit The previous version Inspired by her secret marriage to Jay Z in April 2008 the song explores men s unwillingness to commit a topic that motivated Beyonc to write Single Ladies the only public statement she and Jay Z ever made about marriage 1 Composed by Christopher Tricky Stewart Terius The Dream Nash Thaddis Kuk Harrell and Beyonc Single Ladies is a dance pop and R B song with dancehall disco and bounce influences is definitely wordier and maybe could be condensed a little However Chase combined two completely unrelated thoughts that belong in separate sentences into a single sentence using awkwardly placed en dashes Moreover some of the information Chase removed such as information about what musical style the song is is information that is needed in the lede section of an article about an influential song Chase s version neglects to put that information in the lede at all Personally I d reword it something like this Single Ladies is a dance pop and R B song with dancehall disco and bounce influences It was composed by Christopher Tricky Stewart Terius The Dream Nash Thaddis Kuk Harrell and Beyonc Beyonc was inspired to write Single Ladies after her marriage to Jay Z It explores the unwillingness of men to commit to marriage Hopefully this helps and has given you both some ideas Neither version of the lede is perfect and if you work together instead of fighting each other hopefully you ll be able to improve what is already an excellent article still further problem solving,0

This kind of jumbled intro is what happens when editors have serious differences of opinion You might say that these are the battle ruins of former edit wars Some of these statements were placed where they were to deal with very specific issues at the time and were not necessarily viewed with the overall picture in mind I am myself not above blame in this Overall I agree with your comments and would like to apply fixes but there are a couple of issues that I would like some agreement on before doing anything serious First of all I would say that natural numbers and whole numbers are only sometimes synonyms I don t think that I have seen anyone argue that the whole numbers although not a term that is used technically consist of anything other than zero and the positive integers oh somebody will argue that zero is considered positive by some I will just ignore this as it makes no difference to my statement The ambiguity lies with whether or not zero is considered a natural number For one camp zero is a natural number whole number and natural number are synonyms but for the other camp they are not I don t see how I can implement your suggestion and still please both camps In the sentence starting The whole numbers are the basis I think the intent was to definitely include zero so whole number unambiguously does this but using natural number would require some doctoring As to the run on sentence it definitely needs the period where you placed it The intent of the clause as I see it is to indicate that having the additive identity makes the extension to the integers more natural no pun intended as well as the further extension to the rationals This is alluding to the ring and field properties which the next paragraph doesn t really do I do think that something along these lines should be mentioned here but that clause just doesn t do it right Any thoughts anyone,0
I have placed clarification needed tags by two of these references They may be the wrong tags but the alternative appears to be failed verification which is a bit strong While I don t doubt anyone s integrity if we are using Ms Mukherjee as a source then the original work with page numbers ought to be quoted A third party publication including a review by a second author of the works of the first author is twice removed from the original work with plenty of room for misunderstanding or obscuration through editorialising Reviews like this are tertiary sources and can be taken as a reliable source only when proving that the original author Ms Mukherjee in the case wrote the work in question They cannot be absolutely relied upon to confirm the work s content or opinions,0

Yes but it currently reads At present 39 nation states 40 including TRNC have emerged from the former territories of the Ottoman Empire which stretched from the vicinity of the Strait of Gibraltar in the west to the Caspian Sea and Persian Gulf in the east from the gates of Vienna and the hinterland beyond Kiev in the north to Sudan and Yemen in the south To me that implies that the former territory of the Ottoman Empire stretched up to the gates of Vienna and I don t think that s true Perhaps the Empire s influence extended that far but I don t believe Austria was ever part of Ottoman territory which the preamble currently seems to imply I think this paragraph is actually inaccurate but I m not sure which is why I ve brought it up here If no one can help out then I might have to do a bit of research to find out the greatest geographical extent of the Ottoman Empire extended Currently I think the article exaggerates at least on the Western border,0

The problem with these assertions is a the bullets fired were linked to that specific rifle to the exclusion of all other rifles b Oswald was proven to have purchased the same rifle with the same serial number under an alias c Oswald denied he had a rifle a provable lie d the rifle found in the TSBD was photographed before it was moved and filmed when it was moved and has been verified by numerous photographic experts to have been the same rifle the WC examined e the backyard photographs with the rifle were assessed by experts who noted marks on the stock which matched the same rifle f the photographs the ones with matching negatives were shown to have been unaltered and therefore were authentic images of Oswald with the murder weapon g Oswald under questioning listed all the addresses he lived at save for the one where the photo was taken an omission which suggests he was hiding incriminating information h Oswald s wife and associates confirmed he owned a rifle of the type which he was accused of killing the president with and one of those people had a photo from Oswald holding the rifle with his own handwriting on the photo While one or several of the above facts may not prove that Oswald owned the rifle and that it was the rifle which killed the president it is hard to imagine ALL of the evidence above could have been forged or faked Which would have been required if Oswald s assertion that the Dallas police were trying to frame him for being a Soviet sympathizer Yet that is what we are asked to believe by many pro conspiracy authors There are some doubts on the case because some evidence is ambiguous or evidence wasn t handled as best it could have been But that doesn t prove a negative And these doubts are overwhelmed by the mountain of corroborative evidence And the complete lack of evidence for the presence of another assassin in the TSBD or elsewhere But I suppose some people believe in the Tooth Fairy since his her existence can t be 100 per cent disproven,0
That s ridiculous The book explicitely says that second order Peano Arithmetic is incomplete Then you conclude To be fair Smith gives a good discussion of the fact that second order PA is logically complete That is a clear disagreement Now you re trying to save you re ass by inventing a different definition of completeness for first and second order Peano arithmetic You never made the distinction in the previous discussion In fact I explicitely asked you whether you were using different definitions for the term complete and you said no Therefore I feel comfortable to say that your form of conduct is dishonorable,1

The original poster almost certainly didn t hold the copyright I can t imagine a PBS official logging on to Wikipedia to post material from an obscure three year old web page The article will need to be entirely rewritten rather than be given the tuneup that I was going to give it I lack sufficient knowledge of the subject to rewrite it myself I was going to give the article a cosmetic edit From what I gather though you ll need to rewrite the article on Selim Ahmed Dahoum Temp and the administrators will put it back where it belongs once they ve taken a look at the copyright logs But if you have the information to rewrite it I think that s the appropriate next step Good luck,0

I have changed the text on the theorthodox org And one more thing after we solve the problem can we delete this conversation It s very sad and has nothing to do with the history of Orthodox Church,0
Thanks for inviting me to have this conversation A couple points 1 You raise a worry about a particular passage in the edit but have misunderstood the passage in multiple ways 1 a It does not mean to simply say the human brain works in much the same way that computer programs operate on computer hardware but rather that this is a tenet of the functionalist view of the mind which is the subject of the article 1 b The passage does not suggest anything of the sort about the human brain but about the mind or mental states see diff for proof 1 c The passage does not make the claim you attribute to it and thus it is immaterial to the article that no reliable source makes such a claim 2 You next turn to the source asserting that I ve misrepresented it 2 a You claim the main point of the passage is about nonredusability I can t find that word in my dictionary 2 b Assuming you mean non reducibility you are still mistaken because the entire chapter makes reference to the computer analogy on the basis of several parallels of which irreducibility is but one Other parallels are in terms of the ontological nature of the individual levels both in the case of minds and of computers both possess a formal higher level and a physical lower level as well as the functional natures of the higher levels both have higher levels characterizable in terms of inputs and outputs So you are categorically mistaken here 2 c You say Computer programs do not operate on hardware in much the same way that minds operate on the brain The two are completely different but it s hard to see its relevance to the article which is not about what you think but about the theory of functionalism You seem to have lost track of that along the way 3 It s also worth mentioning that your earlier edit mentioned that your stated complaint was with computers but your edit erased far more than the discussion pertinent to computers I hope you revisit your editing strategies so they only affect relevant content not a far wider content Hope this clears everything up You seem unfamiliar with the issues this article is talking about Some useful background to familiarize yourself with this topic is found on Wikipedia itself Thanks,0

I deleted that song from the discography because as of right now the compilation section only contains alternate takes versions and songs which don t appear on any other album This isn t to say that a list of all their compilation appearances isn t appropriate for that section just that including every appearance of Propagandhi on a compilation will probably more than triple the discography section itself watering it down in my opinion The way I see it what s the point of listing every single compilation that Anti Manifesto has appeared on especially when it s the exact same version found on How to Clean Everything Again my opinion This from a person who bought every compilation with a new Propagandhi song on it only to have 90 of those purchases become obsolete once Where Quantity came out That was frustrating to say the least But if people want to catalog their compilation appearances I m willing to help Like I said I own tons of them As for including details about their activism beyond the lyrics I think that s a great idea Maybe a general note about contributing songs to benefit compilations and then list a few specifics including GASCD Other ideas beyond that Where should it go,0

If the article resembles the one on the Dutch language Wikipedia it is perhaps because as Verdy P had stated as a condition contributors that are relatively well aware of the topic created and worked at the articles To my knowledge these were not the same individuals and I know for certain that the article was not at all a translation but a naturally growing text Thus similarities are due to the topic s nature As for Rex question I do not WP OWN this article and thus do not feel compelled to bring the article into the state that I would prefer but given a few months and provided the article keeps its visibility as primary meaning by the present title I will improve it and hope others do so as well As for Chinese I m hardly a specialist but I assume just about all arguments for Flemish would apply It is most likely that such has not been done properly because few Chinese actually contribute and possibly not so many more read the English language Wikipedia whereas for Dutch and Flemish people their English is often good enough to show up here None of the meanings of Flemish in English is different from the meanings of Vlaams except as the Flemish would be Vlamingen and not Vlaams but not all English sources go as deep into the topic or are as knowledgable even the Encyclopaedia Britannica may have a few problems with respect to interest shown for non English topics Most certainly dictionaries But this is an encyclopaedia and should do a better job at it that is part of the concept of Wikipedia 21 Dec2006 06 06 UTC,0

Greetings Manuel I responded to two of your objections by taking out the mansion and the publishing company I could just as easily accuse you of ignoring that but that would be small of me If you look at the edit history most of the things you are complaining about were put in by other editors The birthday thing for example Someone else put that in However The BBC reports that the Chinese govt claims that Li lied about his birthdate to imitate Shakyamuni Do we say Li lied No We say the Chinese govt says Li lied That is notable enough to stay in the article even though I didn t contribute it To object to an objective report of something another notable party said about the subject bespeaks a certain partisanship on your part We don t want any article turned into a love fest Please read up on relevant Wikipedia policy So things without provenance can be taken out things with provenance can t be taken out as simple as that You ve shown a history of wanting to take out anything that you perceive as reflecting negatively on Li That is reason for me at least to somewhat discount what you are saying to me right there because also since it is the only article you seem to ever work on you seem to have an agenda outside of the encyclopaedia So for what I put in these are my sources Who is Li Hongzhi BBC Interview Li Hongzhi interviewed by Time Magazine Asia 2003 speech by Li I hope this helps,0

What majority rejects the idea that James was homosexual How can you possibly substantiate that The vast majority has no idea Of those who have looked at the subject a clear majority have suggested that at the least James had a homoerotic attachment to some of his favorites particularly Buckingham Whether or not there were actually physical sexual relationships is unclear The fact that James was married and had children is entirely irrelevant So did Oscar Wilde Most of the supposed arguments against James s homosexuality currently in the article are nonsense On the other hand I think the case for James s homosexuality is not as strong as other parts of the article would suggest Basically we have fairly limited sources and such as they are they aren t really sufficient to say for sure one way or the other James s statements about his favorites seem highly suggestive of homoerotic attraction but to assert actual homosexual relationships on this basis seems problematic That James was homosexual or rather that he was sexually attracted to other men or more strongly was involved in sexual relationships with other men seems a reasonable inference but there isn t anything more than circumstantial evidence if that to back it up The problem comes in when people view this question not as a simple question of facts and evidence but as part of an ideological tug of war where the evidence that James was homosexual is a priori found to be false because it conflicts with people s religious views with respect to the version of the Bible that James authorized for some reason or other I m not sure why James can t have both commissioned a good version of the Bible and have engaged in homosexual acts David is the ideal Biblical king but his behavior with respect to Bathsheba and Uriah was highly dishonorable to a much greater extent than any indiscretions one can attribute to James and Buckingham,0

In a nutshell most likely because they a live in climates that are harsh on the feathers in the tropics feather eating molds and bacteria and insects thrive in dry and hot regions such as in Australia there is a lot of abrasive dust and b their bill is not too well suited for preening The colors can generally be considered a social signal enabling conspecifics to recognize each other in the habitat the voice of parrots is under natural conditions not varied enough to provide the wide range of social signals which it does in songbirds for example You ll note that the most colorful areas are the wings which show up in flight and the head the head plumage can be carried in many poses which indicate the bird s mood Amazon parrots for example can prop up a small crest when they are excited normally you don t see it but the birds are apparently able to control which feathers are flush and which ones are fluffed quite well,0
Let s consider the practical consequences of the legislation In 1962 few potential Irish deportees would have been less than 21 That means they must have been born before 1942 Most of their fathers would have been married to their mothers and born before 1922 unless their children were conceived when the fathers were teenagers Their fathers were therefore entitled to the status of British subject Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies BS CUKC created by the British Nationality Act 1948 unless they had been naturalised in a foreign state or had made a Declaration of Alienage Consequently most of the potential irish deportees could have claimed the same full BS CUKC by virtue of being the first legitimate generation born overseas a fact that was common knowledge for both criminals and police,0

Steil is quoted in the text as it stands at this time Dec 2017 in a way that is misleading It makes it sound half way as if he is denying White s guilt In fact Steil is very firm in asserting White s guilt Please fix this Thanks Ira Straus To correct the confusion the question of White s guilt for spying and acting as an agent of Soviet influence needs to be distinguished clearly from the problem of White s lack of sense of guilt or treachery Steil discusses the latter problem too and seems to explain it by the point that White s views were not too far outside of the mainstream of the New Deal as he understood it meaning its leftward half if not majority and its cutting edge tendency My interpretation of his point would be that White and others viewed not the formal US Government but the cause of the New Deal understood as its left side and inclusive of the Soviet Union as one of its international complements as the truest and most legitimate locus for the loyalty of a good citizen the thing to which one is supposed to look up to as the bearer of one s conscience and that one is not supposed to betray This overlap with a factional cause loyalty that pervaded much of the Administration and no doubt the mass media of the time as well is essential for understanding how White was able to survive in positions of power from which he was able to do tremendous damage despite being identified as a spy It apparently affected the mentality even of some such as Truman who did not really believe consciously in the left as the bearer of his conscience yet needed some time to shake free of its hold Ira Straus Many of the denials of White s guilt are logically dependent on the premise ascribed above to White namely that the left factional cause of the New Deal is the proper primary locus of loyalty not the formal US Government As such it might be more accurate to describe some of them as a corollary to that ideological premise and a rewording of it rather than as an independent attestation of conviction that he was not guilty before the formal US Government and its laws Best regards Ira Straus The discussion of whether White s spying did much damage misses the point of why that spying matters Steil went to some length in his Foreign Affairs article on White to detail the several damaging actions White took on behalf of Communist interests giving totals of direct costs to the U S that probably would be many billions of dollars in today s terms His tally does not count the indirect costs such as White s considerable help in undermining the friendly Nationalist government in China and bringing the Communists to power there This gives him a share hard to put an exact number on but substantial of the costs of the Korean War of any future Korean conflict and of any future conflict with China It was understood already by White s critics in the 1950s that this was where he did his real damage What makes the spying important is that it confirms his willingness to commit formal treachery against the formal lawful government of the U S on behalf of Soviet Communism When taken together with the damage he did in his foreign policy actions it establishes the legally guilty motivation for those actions and renders the damage treasonous on a scale probably exceeding that of any other traitor in US history Regards Ira Straus 12 28 17 Steil showed that the Soviets despite their fanatical love of control were aware that White was not very controllable and would be mostly useful to them as an autonomous operator serving their interests Regards Ira Straus 12 28 17,0

Well First Miami Cleveland I should apologize to EVERYBODY for arguing about the merits of my argument I was wrong because this is not the place to do it e g this page clearly says The Talk pages are not a place to debate which views are right or wrong or better If you want to do that there are venues such as Usenet public weblogs and other wikis a quote which someone else clipped deleted when I used it earlier to blame others before I saw my error here Someone else started arguing about whether my case was valid or a conspiracy theory and I took it to a whole new level We were all wrong to do this most of all me because this page is not the place for that type of discussion it is an inappropriate use of space because this page should be limited to discussion of whether the edit is actually something we d see in an encyclopedia describing Terri Schiavo Ok to answer your question yes I do have some problems with the way this page is handled and thank you for asking There are at least five 5 areas in which there is major dispute plus a 6 area of additional dispute something that is a historical fact that should be included in any encyclopedia namely the following 1 Whether Terri was PVS 2 What her wishes were 3 Whether she was terminally ill and whether this disqualified her placement in a hospice 4 Whether Terri was illegally denied therapy rehabilitation examination etc 5 The big one Whether Terri was the victim of felony abuse and whether certain rulings of the judge to deny regular food and water after the feeding tube were pulled stepped over the line and violated various state and federal laws You know that any good encyclopedia tells us that Nazis thought Jews were not fit to live and while most of us know that is garbage these encyclopedias also list things that the Nazis used to try to prove their argument If Nazis get chronicled I certainly do I think my arguments are right and let s not forget that I played a central role in the Schiavo case and in some instances did better than the Florida Governor in court Most or all of you all played no role in this saga Additionally some people get bent over actual human errors like my spelling which I fixed here things that in all likelihood did not harm them I would be open to making restitution of I damaged or harmed someone have faith that s true however we should focus on presenting the historical facts because even if we all agreed it would be hard enough 6 That being said if my success in court was so great even in the absence of news coverage see e g my success should merit coverage After all do a web search and you ll notice that many of these big Blogs list me and my websites Maybe it was bad social skills for me to post my own site which of course is biased but is not the Terri s Blogs and the official Terri s Fight site biased Even Matt Conigliaro the attorney who hosts Abstract Appeal is biased as evidenced by his comments to the reporter in which he claims that the judges followed the law this is false as far as I m concerned even though he rarely lets his bias slip out Abstract Appeal while not as correct is clearly less biased but if the official website for Terri Schiavo s family is listed and it is clearly the most biased site taking stances on the husband that even I am not sure about then why should the two Register mirror front page news be omitted from the commentary advocacy links and also why should The Register s Court Cases compilation be omitted It too is a compilation which fits in one of the top categories We all have our personal opinion but at this rate of argument we aren t going to do encyclopedias justice at recoding the actual facts FuelWagon for all his ranting and raving makes one good point earlier that bears repeating We should not state anything as fact unless it is unambiguous and agreed on by all people even if it is only to shut up the nuts on either side of the argument So when I decide to post a link to a state or federal law if it is not lengthy and if it s relevant it should NOT be stricken thank you These encompass my arguments as best as I can see them,0
I absolutely agree with Tomer that non Jews are fascinated by Jews and insatiably curious about Judaism so we are writing for everyone Yoninah whoever is hooked up to the Internet and even those who will utilize information from Wikipedia in other mediums However my point about having a disclaimer is NOT because I am worried that indain will look up the Rambam and be confused sic Jon513 s words What a joke My concern is that the infobox provides NO CONTEXT for the reader It presents the reader with a wiki link making it impossible to judge the true origins nature or the level of application if at all of the Halakha in any way It takes many years to learn this process that is why there are wiki link programs and it can t just be understood by reading the wiki link article It is precisely because you are going to have millions of non Jews looking at these articles and then scratching their heads as if to say Hello what is this law Does it apply How important is it and the disclaimer will help them understand that not all laws are equal in Judaism because similar by analogy to the non Jewish world some things are just wiki link i e wiki link and wiki link for which there is no real punishment but then there are laws of various grades that go in ascending order from wiki link minor punishments to wiki link serious severe punishments and then wiki link severe extreme punishments with the wiki link acting as the written law to guide the process and the origins of laws and a wiki link to serve as an ongoing mechanism for the application or rejection of laws In fact just as an example look at the following US Constitution template as an example of a comprehensive guideline that clarifies how US law functions which Infobox Halacha so far does not do,0

It seems that you are content on having a biased article Wikipedia is supposed to be neutral i e having both or all sides of the story so that the informed reader can make up their own minds as to further study or investigation of claims Whether James was Gay or not it is not the issue the issue is having a non biased article At present the article basically says James was Gay but there are many who contest that view This is a fact and must be mentioned because it provides the reader with the whole picture not one sided bias If for example the article stated that James was not gay and you came along and said that he is gay although I might not like it I would be forced to let you add that to the article because there is indeed many vocal people who claim this For this reason I am reverting the article If this cannot be reasoned perhaps we can mediate Also when you finish a post please put 4 s that will put your name and time you posted thanks,0
This has got to be the idiotic edit of the night Republican can refer to a system of government political movements a concept political parties etc So obviously you believe that the Republican Party in the US is fighting for a republic which the US um happens to be So what exactly links the modern US Republican Party to republic Or do you believe that the Republican versus Democratic clash in the US is actually a clash between anti democratic Republicans and anti republican Democrats This is utterly crazy Your edit here is blatant vandalism,1

What I said is true The comment above that one said this A few points of clarification I think that here at wikipedia our personal assessment of a particular source often needs to be held in check Your assessment of Frazer s interpretation of Jefferson s statement is different from mine It seems to me that Jefferson s words clearly indicate a general belief in God s involvement in human affairs Frazer s work has an entire chapter not a vague sentence on Jefferson s religious views For the article lengthy discussion is not appropriate so I presented Frazer s strongest single piece of evidence which is usually ignored by the Jefferson was a Deist camp Secondly I was not disputing Enlightenment influence on the American founders but rather the threefold connection of Deism Enlightenment and the American founding I have read May s book as well as many other books relating to Enlightenment philosophy American colonial education and the lives and thinking of the founders including lesser known founders like Witherspoon Wythe and Wilson The Americans were much more likely to read theists like Shaftesbury and Hutcheson for example than Voltaire or Rousseau There were cross currents in the Enlightenment so the vague unsourced statement linking Deism the Enlightenment and the American founders seems to be not only against wikipedia policy but also misleading and unhelpful Other Choices This user seems much better informed over all And there are several comments above that one and the one you quoted I found to be the least informative and the most opinionated Phrases like Republican rant book and claiming without referencing anything in specific that said book s isn t properly research or however they put it is perfectly meaningless All they gave was a political opinion when you boil down the substance And this statement several of the founding fathers were Deists is also opinion based on the fact that there are history books that contradict each other on the subject If you like I can reference a few books for you to read Preceding wiki link comment added by,0

Note that according to other material in the article some people choose to apply the anchor baby label to US born children of legal as well as illegal immigrants And in theory some people in the US on a student visa H 1B etc might imagine that their chances of staying longer possibly even getting a green card could be improved by having a US born child So in some people s view at least there may in fact be a valid connection here with the concept of birth tourism I think it s perfectly fine that there is a source regarding Michelle Malkin that doesn t explicitly use the expression anchor baby The source is supporting the claim that Malkin was born to legal non citizen immigrant parents This point is relevant because some people may see an incongruity with anti anchor baby comments from someone who would herself be defined by some as an anchor baby by people who choose to apply this term to all US born children of immigrants not just children of illegal immigrants The fact that the source itself does not say anchor baby is not a problem in this case IMO if C chullain disagrees with me on this I d certainly be open to hearing his reasons,0

Hi The article is not deleted for good I can still restore it if necessary I will have a look at this and sort it out either later today or tomorrow when I have time REPLY TO Globalunv Ok I actually just had a chance to look at this now The entire history section is a copy of the website linked I cant check the original sources for these as the are not available online I know that the version was here on Wikipedia on 28 September 2015 but I don t know when the version on the website was published Because of this I am not happy with restoring it Your options now to possibly get your article restored are to confirm that the website is licenced under Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike donate the copyrighted material to Wikipedia you can read how to do that wiki link or you can appeal the deletion wiki link I more thing you should be aware that Wikipedia doesn t not allow usernames that imply that more than one person is sharing the account or that the person behind the account is editing on behalf of a company or organisation wiki link I suggest you wiki link as your current account may be blocked from editing Let me know if you need any more help with anything,0

Let begin with the first comment I m not trying to suppress anything Let me assit you in straightening that out I have never stated that her traffic violations should not be in the article I have stated over and over again that there is no need for a long laundry list of them They are a small portion of her life and just because a political campaign is going onwhere her driving record is being used as a weapon by Herseth Sandlin does not mean that Wikipedia should treat the topic just as the Herseth Sandlin campaign would The description needs to be trimmed down Also since there is a comparison to the former Congressman Janklow then it is clear that this is a campaign issue And since it is a campaign issue then there needs to be a counterweight to the overwrought description of her traffic violations in the article And finally I appreciate your suggestion that I cite information about other aspects of Noem s life but let s say I add info about her love to work in the garden for example does not provide a counterweight to the over the top description of her traffic violations I will edit the section in a manner that deals with real issue that I have outlined,0

Serhiychuk is a historian who analyses the data It is a secondary source The fact that he also includes a reprint of the source documents allows one to check his analysis Obviously the topic is currently a heated one with the whole year marked as a memorial to the Holodomor The Note of protest from the Soviet Embassy is dated July 5 1983 It states The Embassy of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics notifies the respected Minister of Foreign Affairs of Canada and has the honour of turning the attention of the Ministry to the intentions of the Edmonton section of the Committee of Ukrainians in Canada to erect a monument to the so called victims of Famine in Ukraine of 1932 33 This action cannot not be viewed as a indecent anti soviet action whose goal is to turn away from the truth regarding the collectivisation of village farms in the USSR to promote hatred to the USSR and the Soviet people It is visible tht the plans to erect such a monument are supported by the city government of Edmonton which passed a resolution to allow the erection of the monument in the central square of the city Such activities attacking the USSR from the official government in association with activists of the right extremist centres in Canada including the union of War criminals of the so called Ukrainian Insurgent Army the SS division Galizien and others cannot be supported Attention is brought to the anti Soviet manifestation in Toronto on May 29 this year regarding the so called Famine in Ukraine which amongst its organizers was one of the leaders of the pro fascist League of Freedom for Ukraine V Didiuk the head of the brotherhood of former soldiers of the SS Galizien division O Sokolsky and the participation of members of the federal and provincial parliaments Whatever formal excuses these former hitlerite cronies use to hide under under the to mask their anti Soviet actions in Canada the patronage of the government officials makes a mockery of the millions of Soviet people who became victims of German Fascism in the years of the Second World War The Embassy voices its protest against anti Soviet for that reason of the erection of the above mentioned monument It expects that actions will be taken in the prohibition of its construction The Embassy uses this occassion to remind the Ministry in its high and important regard 6 copies 5 July 1983 1 2 to addresses 3 filed 4 2EO 5 Central Committee of Communist party of Ukraine 6 Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ukr SSR 27 June 1983 Ottawa,0

Sorry Neil I was thinking a few things over plus I have the kid 16 months old boy D ya know what kind of stress that is all alone since the wife is in Japan at the moment so I can t be busy with this ALL the time I already have spent way too much time on it You ll understand To the point I see Peter has again written a loooooong story down here My congratulations to his suddenly changed attitude but I am not gonna react to anything he writes any more It all comes down to the same he keeps disagreeing and referring to some documents that proof nothing He keeps claiming that I contradict myself which is NOT true Okay I will react to that one to explain the book Shukumine wrote is indeed called Shin Karated Ky han that translates into something like The Teaching Methods of the New Karated Indeed he doesn t mention the name of the style Genseiryu I say now do you know Gichin Funakoshi The founder of Shotokan He also wrote a book about his style Do you know what it is called Karated Ky han The teaching methods of Karatedo This book also doesn t contain the name of the style of Shotokan Also his other four books they all talk about karate in a general way without mentioning the name of the style That was common at the time Japanese karate masters didn t care about the name of the style they created They only wanted it to be good and they wanted to pass it on The name is not important Not convinced Check the books that were written by Ch jun Miyagi the creator of G j ry Check the books of yama Masutatsu the founder of Kyokushin kaikan Four of his five books don t mention the name of the style they just talk about karate I have a book on the shelf called Karate by Marcel Meeus 1987 ISBN9002158815 Nowhere in the book the name of the style is mentioned Only by the tribute page for Gichin Funakoshi page 14 people can understand it s about SHOTOKAN but only if they understand that Funakoshi was the creator of it Oh and I tried to explain before Kory is NOT a name it only means old school and that is exactly what Shukumine did combine old techniques Kory with new ones to come to Genseiry So what if he called his kata Kory kata That doesn t make any difference to Genseiry So I was NOT contradicting myself AT ALL Now back to Seiken Shukumine no matter what he called the kata the kata are in the book and they were then and they are now considered Genseiryu kata What s in a name That s all I want to say about Peter s reaction down here The rest I leave as it is which does NOT mean I agree with it However if you or anybody else have any specific questions I ll be happy to answer them WGKF is what it is The sources are what they are I mentioned 2 books I mentioned the agreement of the WGKF itself I mentioned the website of the official Genseiryu headquarters and I mentioned a Taid site a different martial art that is not connected to WGKF That should be enough I see numerous articles on Wikipedia with a lot less references Now it s up to some Japanese speaking editor to check the Japanese references but I did my utmost to create a NPOV article I would like to add more but I can t find the right references So I will refrain from adding that If anybody still would like to dispute the whole article I think it should be done by a sentence by sentence breakdown of the article just like Neil suggested above Oh and if you want to archive this talk page that is totally fine with me Hopefully everybody will from then on focus on the content and nothing else but the current content Now back to life Hey somebody s gotta cook tonight,0

There has been a lot of rather woolly thinking and propaganda over this Bohemian Rhapsody was the first ever music video thing over the years clearly it was not the first accompanying promotional film for a single since ever Queen recorded earlier promo films for their stuff never mind dozens of other bands what WAS a first about it was that it started off the practice of a record company providing a promotional video film for their acts single release with the express purpose of it being used on Top of the Pops when the act were not available to perform themselves prior to this the BBC would play the record and have dancers like Pan s People perform to it on screen This was a big sea change and should be noted in the article,0
inaccurate to leave out sounds strange I m not against having Daly in the lead Honestly I think the lead needs a re write I do not think his credit as the executive producer really needs a mention though As for the tags I do not like them either my advice is to re write content so it a matches the source and b makes it better for readers So I m leaning towards we re write the lead as a whole but I d like your input on that too My personal preference would be to not include citations in the lead but am open to it if is required to write something really good that follows MOS FILM and MOS INTRO,0

you have for a second time refused to answer the question regarding any conflicts of interest you may have in relation to this article If you have no such COIs it would be easy for you to make a categorical statement here that you have never received any payments or other benefits for your work on this article or have any other conflicts of interest that may prejudice your editing of this article Yet in spite of being asked twice you have not made such a statement even though wikipedia guidelines state that conflict of interest issues should be addressed in the first instance on article talk pages So for a third time this is a request for your conflict of interest statement If you do not provide one it can only be assumed that you do have conflicts of interest and thus the appropriate course of action would be to report you on the Wikipedia Conflict of interest Noticeboard I have alerted to this discussion via his user page because a categorical statement indicating that he has no conflicts of interests would also be appreciated You may wish to read Wikipedia s guidelines on conflicts of interest In particular note the definition of a COI Any external relationship personal religious political academic financial including holding a cryptocurrency or legal can trigger a COI,0

Seems wp own would apply to the editor who is edit warring to remove a reference from the article and this isn t the first time you ve done this MaxBrowne I never removed your addition of the Town Hall reference I objected to your repeated removal of the Winchester Star ref I think it s completely fine to reference both but if for some strange reason you absolutely insist on using just one it makes more sense to use the one that was originally in the article the Winchester Star version because this one has Snowflake Generation in its title making it more on topic for this particular article Your repeated removal of reliable source references seems disruptive and it seems concerning given your assertion that article should be slimmed right down which so far has not gained support on any of the noticeboards you have posted to When you keep removing various references it honestly comes across as if you are trying to weaken the sourcing prior to gutting this article of massive amounts of content Please stop,0

First off I ve never heard of Northumbrian Gaelic and google doesn t find a single instance of the term although google isn t really suitable for any serious research Now turning to this particular issue the proposed Gaelic etymology has little basis anywhere but in this article from what I can see The Wikipedia article on chav which incidentally is much more well written and more likely to be factually correct than charva states the common theory that it s of Romany origin The relation between charva and chav can probably not be denied given the similarity of the terms The Wiktionary entry on chav links it with a couple of possible Romany words including charver prostitute which further strengthens the relation between charva and chav The single search result found on dictionary com gives the etymology perh Romany chav child which corresponds to one of the Wiktionary suggestions In short there s plenty of evidence for a Romany origin and from what I can see none for a Gaelic origin I might edit charva to correspond to the etymology given on chav,0

The key here is that the secrets aren t the point As a note Eagle Scouts all have a secret handshake which we usually forget entirely but no one would claim that this is of central importance to knowing what an Eagle Scout is Same with the Masons I just did an informational meeting actually and people were much more concerned with what Masons do in terms of community service and activities than any religious position or secret anything I think things like Learning Centers for dyslexic children Shriners hospitals scholarships child identification programs and other charities and charitable activities Masonry supports are much more important encyclopedically speaking than the secrets of the Fraternity because what we do is much more important I m going to go out on a limb here and say that not one of us here joined to learn secrets we joined in order to better ourselves and make a difference in our communities I used this argument already before but if it works why change I could say that the secret of the 35th degree is a word called flepgnopfarpian but you re never going to find a 35th degree and you re never going to find the word because I made them both up However if you can t find it does it mean that it is secret or that it is wrong How do you objectively prove it Anti Masonic sources are POV and tend to exaggerate and the Masonic sources won t necessarily mention it However if you want the real secret here it is the real secret of Masonry isn t a word or a sign or anything like that The real secret of Masonry is intangible and indescribable and if you re not a Mason you ll never understand it I will also note that this is my personal private opinion and I don t speak for the Fraternity in any way by any stretch of the imagination,0

The preceding unsigned comment was added by Whether or not you believe your comments to be accurate they were unencyclopaedic and inappropriate for Wikipedia WP strives to achieve a neutral point of view and your comments were clearly unbalanced and lacked justification For example phrases such as At night Aldershot town centre becomes a war zone a no go area for decent people and the Rotten Borough of Rushmoor are clearly statements of opinion and not fact Rushmoor is not a rotten borough in the formal sense and the remark is potentially confusing to other readers never mind the obvious negative bias in the term Who are your decent people and how have you asserted the relevance of their opinions on this page encyclopaedia I also note from your talk page that you have previously been blocked from editing WP due to vandalism On a more constructive note perhaps you would care to rewrite your comments giving an even handed treatment to all viewpoints and providing appropriate sources to support your comments Otherwise you are wasting your time and your comments will undoubtedly be reverted by other editors not just myself Finally please sign your comments on talk pages using four tildes thus,0

This is entirely the WRONG RfC to be having The editor who started this thing is confused about the state of the discussion apparently hung up on ancient history The current issues are laid out in my General Observations in the Second drafts subsection immediately above especially the first two The first RfC in what will apparently have to be a long series of them should likely be whether there should be a separate Religious views section of the sort being contemplated when the article already has a Controversies section touching on these issues along with other related ones I have been unable to get anyone to acknowledge the existence of either this Controversies section or my references to it The current Controversies section can briefly accommodate the proposed subject Having a separate Religious views section would require a major rewrite and restructuring of the Controversies section and perhaps even its elimination These Same sex marriage in articles which are clearly focused on providing the current legal status of civil same sex marriage within the geographical jurisdictions they contemplate have their way of very briefly and in passing dealing with religious views and this new proposed way isn t it This RfC should be abandoned and replaced with the proper one,0

I say have at it I only started the process because I saw the problem There are still a number of problems with the article as a whole A number of the gramatical issues pointed out are a result of trying to mush multiple versions into one My only advice is The article is about Ruth not the New York Yankees the Boston Red Sox or any other team It is also not about his manager friends or parents Those topics should be touched on but should not become the focus of any single section,0

Jossi you keep dismissing critics of Rawat as a tiny minority but isn t it possible that in fact a much much larger number of people who know of Rawat either because they once followed him or simply followed him in the news think he s a charlatan Obviously it s hard to quantify numbers of either such group of critics but you seem unable to even acknowledge their existence Correct me if I m wrong but isn t your view that the only people who object to Rawat are the ones who bother to speak out against him It sure seems that way On the other hand isn t it reasonable to infer from the fact that only a tiny minority of people who were initiated by Rawat in the West at least still follow him that many if not most no longer respect him After all Rawat s program is a life long program is it not It s not like a four year plumbing course To the contrary with teachings like this People say You come in this world empty handed and you ll go empty handed I say that you came empty handed definitely but you don t need to go empty handed Take something with you Take that enjoyment with you Recognize that supreme joy and then go it s clear that Rawat never intends his followers to leave him So wouldn t it be fair to assume that of those that do at least some sugnificant number are disillusioned Likewise think of all the people who heard Rawat s grand offer of learning the secret of peace inside or however you or he puts it For free even Wouldn t it be only fair and reasonable to think that many if not most of those people find Rawat unattractive for whatever reason That they have an opinion in other words and it s not very flattering Also don t you think one can make some fair inferences about Rawat s general image in the world by the fact that he first came on full throttle clamouring for the world to take him seriously as the Perfect Master of our time but that campaigns like Who is Guru Maharaj Ji failed and Rawat felt compelled to stop doing press conferences stop making media appearances and to retreat from making the same kind of grand some would say grandiose promises as he was making in things like the DUO Proclamation Isn t it only reasonable to think that that many people if they remember him at all remember him as a bit of a joke and nothing more Put another way what if there wasn t a tiny minority of ex premies actively criticizing Rawat online Would you then be of the view that he s generally respected amongst all the people who either stopped following him or turned down his offer in the first place Can t you see how weird that would be,0
No It is more complicated than that Once again your wording is setup entirely as a way of portraying Obama and his administration negatively instead of neutrally For example you use conservative terminology like corporate welfare that is completely inappropriate Also your language makes it sound like Obama signed the stimulus bill specifically in order to protect AIG bonuses rather than to try to fix the broken economy,0
Benford s law applies most accurately to data that are distributed smoothly across many orders of magnitude is just false and should be removed Consider a variable uniformly distributed between 1 and 10 12 I believe this qualifies as distributed smoothly across many orders of magnitude The probability of the first digit of this variable being 1 is exactly 0 1 Moreover the picture showing the probability in semi log plot is extremely misleading The shaded area correspond to the probability only if this graph is P log x not P x graphed in semi log scale If it is P log x and it is expected to be almost uniform so that you can apply the area proportional to width argument then that means the probability P x itself has to be a linearly decreasing function or a decreasing function that look almost linear at least over one order of magnitude at every point so that P log x P x dx d log x x P x looks uniform I noticed that there was a note on the picture explaining that this graph is not a plain probability graphed in semi log scale but given the explanation above you can see how a non expert audience can be mislead just by reading the section and looking at the picture that a uniform distribution follows Benford s law,0

Probably probably probably We can t assume anything It s already mentioned in the article that some believe he could have been Tsar Simeon It doesn t matter what other writers said thought what s important is his own ethnic identity Isn t that the reasoning you ve used in the past with people from Macedonia The source you provided doesn t say much about his ethnicity in fact it doesn t say anything about his ethnicity It lists him along with some other medieval Slavic writers as being old Bulgarians Even then that s the opinion of one man who also happens to be Bulgarian Surprised I m not I don t doubt he considered himself Bulgarian the problem is that Wikipedia can t make such assumptions Is that scientific enough for you,0

The inclusion criteria should be clearly defined to exclude organizations that are not notable enough for their own articles Many of the groups listed are local and very small groups Wikipedia is not a directory nor is it an indiscriminate collection of information The list in its current state would be comparable to a list of Christian organizations that includes the little Baptist church just down the street National groups that have received substantial coverage in independent reliable sources such as the SSA should definitely go in a list like this but not most local groups such as AHA at UW Madison,0

EVERYBODY needs to quit having edit wars over the PVS diagnoses Here s my proposed compromise NCDave and the conservative crew want mention of the minimally conscious state right at the top left leaners don t want that I support the left leaners in their wish to omit it because after only a few sentences in the introduction it DOES mention other doctors diagnosed Terri as minimally conscious However the article mentions both sides of the court doctors but only one side of the NON court appointed doctors namely the doctors that Mike Schiavo personally picked This is biased presentation and either they need to be deleted this is option one or option two there needs to be mention that a long line of doctors the Schindlers picked also questioned Terri s PVS diagnosis The fact that many of them could not examine Terri personally is not Terri s parent s fault and this fact would need to be mentioned is option two is picked I have sided partially with both sides and I think this compromise is fair,0

Tasc you are undermining the NPOV of the article by adding your own POVs You have proven before on other articles ex Sochi to have anti Georgian bias and as I noticed you are slowly implementing your own ideas into articles which are related to Georgian events I highly recommend you to maintain NPOV regardless of your Russian background and start a constructive co operation with other editors like Kober who have contributed to Wikipedia tremendously Pro separatist nationalist POV will not be tolerated on any post soviet conflict articles Take a look at Nagorny Karabakh a good example of co operation and respect for NPOV,0
I re added Poe s Law the humourous one to the list as apart from Earle Martin and the anonymous IP poster above 67 135 49 198 everyone here seems to agree that it is notable enough to be included or at the very least hasn t said one way or the other In addition if we applied Earle Martin s standards if it doesn t have sources that meet the same verifiability standards as a full article it doesn t get included to everything on this list the majority of this list would have to be deleted As such it seems like for whatever reason Earle Martin is fairly blatently applying double standards in order to try to keep Poe s Law off this list,0
I d agree purely on the basis that assuming that it did occur and I don t think it would be that difficult to prove there are several reliable sources indicating such incidents at the hands of police and other officials all around Australia eg the Bringing Them Home report for it to be in this biography either Joh would need to have been ordering it or speaking extensively on it or otherwise personally involved and likewise that it was either some radical departure from the past or otherwise connected with his time in office I don t think that can be established on any safe ground An example of the sort of thing that could be included we had a rather odd incident in Western Australia in the 70s involving a mining lease over an Aboriginal reserve which became hugely controversial and in the end never went ahead The premier of the day was very active in the debate taking a strong personal stand on it and even his lawn suffered for the privilege someone drilled holes in it,0

I have become the object of a complaint alleging me as a regular violator of Wiki s 3 revert rule Wiki policy prohibits use of my name in the complaint but there is no doubt I am the subject and the complaint was made according to Wiki policy and every editor has this prerogative This talk page is pointed to for administrative review of this allegation hence I address it here for whomever I categorically deny having violated Wiki s 3RR I certainly am not a regular violator of this Wiki policy or any other I am aware of Most recently May 13 2007 I made three reverts during a 24 hour period But no more than this Earlier there were editing changes to this document but these were not reverts they were edits discussed by participants on this talk page and my editing was an attempt to follow the discussion On this talk page in the section Lead paragraph is the transcript of editors working through my editing A main point of contention was over presentation form I had introduced quoted material from primary and secondary sources in an attempt to let Jehovah s Witness representatives speak for themselves I did this because rival editors preferred to let Jehovah s Witnesses represent themselves as they prefer whereas other editors desired to take more of an anti approach This was an attempt to alleviate bickering and to verify the presentation But my use of quoted material was objected to so I removed the quotation marks and left the thorough references as I continued working with editorial views The discussion then proceeded to how much paraphrase was needed in the absence of quotation marks Unfortunately accusations of plagiarism were leveled and addressed This discussion too is documented in the same section Lead paragraph The end of this bit of editing not reverting was when rival editor in the academic sense Dtbrown replied Thank you for removing the plagiarism The 3 reverts I performed were done after this discussion was over and not before However I do not think even these reverts should accumulate under Wiki policy because Wiki guidelines expressly states that any editor is permitted to remove any language that is not verified in the article The only thing my reverts did was remove unverified declarations and nothing more Hence my impression is these reverts were done entirely within Wiki policy Nevertheless I was careful to avoid even a semblance of violating Wiki policy by resisting any urge to delete the same unverified information when it was again reverted back to by the same editor Only today has this vying editor finally installed a reference for the offending language academic sense And at this point it remains debatable whether this reference represents a consensus of knowledge on the subject it addresses In defense of my participation here even a cursory review of my comments demonstrates a desire to talk about editing prior to making changes I doubt any editor here will deny the thoroughness I have applied to this discussion whether they agree with my conclusions or not I have offered proposals responded to proposals offered references pro and con for the subject of dispute I have even done research at the request of and for rival editors Hence it leaves me confused and amazed that any editor would allege what they have of me,0

First I object to being stalked on the Internet You don t know me and my sig is GDallimore Stalking someone is what we who live in polite society call behaving like a fuckwit and I shall treat you as such from here on in Second just because you haven t understood the problem with the section doesn t mean I have moved the goalposts It is your understanding that has changed not my position which has and has always been that an entire section devoted to a detailed commentary on the work of one author without any criticism of that position is giving that one author undue weight And I quote I summarised an overlong series of specific quotes from one single source which has not had any independent review The fact it was not phrased directly as a question is irrelevant when the question is obviously implied and to feign ignorance and complain otherwise is called wikilawyering or in other words behaving like a fuckwit again try to actually pay attention to the simple argument being made here and respond to it And so finally I repeat for the hard of hearing stalker man I DID NOT delete the material I cut it back to a suitable length You re the one banging on about Stenger s position and it seems to me that an appropriate solution would be to give this author as much weight as Stenger which means briefly summarising his position which is EXACTLY what I did Perhaps my only mistake was not to move that summary into the next section of the article alongside the summary of Stenger s views Note also that the position put forward by Stenger has a sourced criticism Seems to me that Stenger s position and the criticism of it is ripe for expansion in the name of NPOV That would be a worthwhile addition to an encyclopedia Not this extensive quoting of one person s book,1
Anyway I think I have this stupid edit war over Wikipedia does not necessarily demand that a source be canon For instance when discussing Dracula of the Castlevania series should we just keep any mention of Castlevania Legends or Castlevania Circle of the Moon out of the article since they are retconned No What matters is that the comic that portrays their relationship is not fan fiction but is perfectly legal and authorized by Capcom In the event that someone uses it to argue on a universal scale of their relationship no But the fact that they are romantically connected in this official source deserves mention as much as Princess Peach being romantically contected with Mario does,1

List looks good Most are footnoted Haven t checked to see whether footnotes not only verify notability hardest but attendance at Belem can be easy if in a single Belen list My thought is to keep the Nobel prize winners unlike Harvard and full generals and the like and fork the remainder of the list Will probably be a lot more right Most elite places fork their list The school is just too important to allow it to be eclipsed by a bunch of one line bios IMO Another suggestion is to elimnate red links from people whose credentials have been established with footnotes and whose attendance has been established with a footnote maybe from Belen itself The same footnote for each,0

The problem is that brazil really is spelled wrong I m pretty sure that Brasil would sound just the same as brazil but the anglophone countries don t care wether they are snubing our culture and preferences or not together with a handful of anglophilic brazilians to whom many times other civilization s cultures worth a lot more than our own brazil is a romantism and it should be banned simply because it never existed Someday perhaps when the US dominate the Amazon there may be such a thing as Brazil While we still have our country in our hands we should be doing everything we can in order to prevent cultural dependency which has already started to become a reality We could be a candidate for 51st state and this would be a funny and ironic thing because 51 is a very popular number in Brasil Our people enjoy Hollywood better than Brasilian cinema Many youngsters do not know how true samba and Brasilian music sound anymore Brasilian literature is being replaced by subliterature like Harry Potter and Dan Brown And to cap it all the majority of intelectual people agree that brazil is right and Brasil is wrong despite of the fact that o Brasil n o conhece o brazil The brazilians don t agree with me and think that ufanism is ridiculous but it s a matter of time to see who is right A country with strong cultural identity cannot be pushed around by anyone Nevertheless judging by how things are going when it comes the time that Brasil represent a peril to the allies and it sure will as we have plenty of the fuel of life itself there will be no need for a war on terror as people will find it marvelous to be bullied Like stated before my group and I will not be changing brazil to Brasil anymore that s a promise as we respect the wikicommunity This is a humble try to make people seize the Brasilian culture a bit more while it still exists,0

There were no anarcho capitalists at that time of course there wouldn t be any criticism at that period To make the positive claim that no individualist anarchist questions the pedigree of anarcho capitalism as a form of anarchism you need to provide evidence The burden of proof is on nobody but yourself What you re essentially asserting is that God exists because nobody can prove that he doesn t,0
does not control this article We all do and Chloe Wong s edits were not as controversial as all that Be bold Most people don t even bother with the courtesy of explaining their edits here the fact that munboy isn t discussing any of the points raised and the fact that he is relying solely on dismissive statements to justify a blind reversion of all of her edits even her removal of the cheap shot at Target undermines his credibility I ve uh restored the removal of the cheap shot at Target I really don t want to get into the benefits and criticisms because it ties in with the split or not split argument that I ve already stated my position on in the last go round,0

WP SELFPUB is fine as long as the material is not unduly self serving and in this case the number may appear to be an exaggeration Instead it may be good to say As of 2003 there were over 500 NKT IKBU centers and groups in Europe and North America The organization now claims over 1100 in 40 countries The first sentence can be verified in a third party source namely Bluck p 132 while the figure for the second sentence is from a self published source I think this is a good approach using the latest third party verified source available Bluck cites data from 2003 and also the latest numbers reported by the organization itself,0

Hello I have restored with minor editing of grammar and some re arrangement for clarity the culinary uses section as it stood prior to Lumifers removal of most of the interesting materials there In my opinion that page was a model for the sort of information that OUGHT to be included in any page referring to a food item The biological information is important but if I look up bitter melon on wikipedia the main thing I want to know is how do I cook the thing As for sounding too much like a cookbook all of that is down to the one recipe in the Pakistani section which contains the following sentence Now the pan is covered with a lid heat reduced to minimum the tomatoes reduce and all the spices work their magic But so what If somebody from North American wants to know about bitter melon it is extremely helpful to get an idea of what people around the world do with the thing Was that hurting anyone The new page by contrast was unreadably dry If for some reason someone feels that this information belongs on a seperate ways to prepare bitter melon page then by all means create such a page but please do not simply wantonly delete information that is useful and interesting to many people That Pakistani recipe for example and the Nepalese information is unlikeand better thananything I ve found elsewhere on the web Finally even if the original section was in want of pruning the new oneas it stood before I restored the September versionwas even worse It seemed like little more than a catalog of names in foreign languages with highly limited and vague references to preparation methods Who cares about the names for dishes if we aren t even going to be told what the dishes are Thank you,0

David Thought this might be what you were looking for in your comments about Gus Grissom In January 1963 shortly after the second group of astronauts was selected the pilots were given specialty assignments in the MSC programs Grissom one of the smaller astronauts was assigned to the Gemini spacecraft Because of this and his Mercury experience he was very close to the McDonnell engineers and technicians so close in fact that the cockpits of the first three spacecraft were designed around him giving him the best view of the instrument panel and out the window The spacecraft was familiarly dubbed the GUSMOBILE Although Young was only two inches taller his seat had to be compressed so he could fit into it Stafford had to have adjustments made on both the seat and hatch to accommodate his six foot frame By July 1963 the program office had discovered that 14 of the 16 astronauts could not be fitted into the cabin as designed and all later cockpits had to be modified The HBO series From Earth to the Moon has a scene with Grissom and Deke Slayton in which Slayton infers that Grissom will be the first astronaut to walk on the moon I would LOVE to find out if that is just fiction It does make sense one of the orginal 7 and flew on Mercury Gemini and Apollo petegrk peter freytag Colorado,0

Shivraj you haven t addressed the issue The topic of this NPOV discussion is not whether Muller s theories were right I personally have absolutely no opinion about that The discussion is on whether you Shivraj can bring verifiable references showing that some reputable authority today believes that Muller s motives in developing his theory were shaped by racist prejudice That s what s claimed as a fact in the paragraph you wanted to have inserted And as long as you don t source it it can t stay It s that simple I reapeat my plea please read WP NPOV and Wikipedia Verifiability carefully By the way the quote you give above actually claims the exact opposite it says that Muller s theories were motivated by archaeological linguistic and ethnological evidence available at the time By the way I don t know where in the above the quote ends and where your own comment starts Please be more careful in quoting stuff,0

Hello I have observed that since this century turned new cars have had headlamp lenses made out of plastic Before headlamp lenses were made out of thick glass that reminded me of wiki link cooking vessels intended for use inside an oven Is it true that it was in fact heat resistant borosilicate glass What is the plastic in use nowadays I suppose it is wiki link plastic but is it regular or somehow treated coated I would want answers to these questions in the article Also were the transition to plastic lenses possible only after halogen lamps became history I believe that halogen lamps emitted so much heat that polycarbonate would have melted So if the transition was only possible because of technological development in lamps and a consequence of this better efficiency less heat please point it out in the article Also I suppose the use of plastic resulted in weight savings but is there some drawbacks in plastic I found some info about high heat polycarbonate EXTERNA LINK,0

I think I would be a good idea to merge this article with the one about early Basque Euskera arcaico in the Spanish Not only this save many cross references but it will allow to include more epigraphical material which isn t Aquitanian for example the inscriptions found at Soria La Rioja with Vasconic personal names In this way the Iberian material would be moved to the Iberian article The idea would be to show what Mitxelena s pre Basque is and how this has allowed us to recognize the language behind Aquitanian inscriptions as an archaic form of Basque etc etc,0

Oh yes Syriac Christians is with no doubt the preferable term I m just saying Syrian Chrsitians are still by some used to describe the Syriac Christians And the Megalommatis source was just to prove my point that Syrian is still used to desribe the Syriac people And don t you think I know what Megalomamatis have written Believe me I m aware of it and if I wanted to use him as my source I would already have done it But it s a bit ironic though I know nothing about the American Chronicle but I m guessing it s a kind of a American news agency and we all know what some people here are using as their sources,0

I agree that a summary style treatment of both the favorable and unfavorable significant trends in opinion polling should be included in the main bio article It is the better NPOV solution The wording should accurately represent the source to avoid any OR problems The NBC Wall Street Journal poll released today shows a further drop in her popularity and a majority of voters feel that Palin is not qualified to be president The Wall Street Journal article on the poll stated The one candidate whose popularity has fallen is Gov Palin 38 see her positively down from 44 two weeks ago 47 see her negatively up 10 points from the last poll That s the highest negative rating of the four candidates Fifty five percent of voters say Gov Palin is not qualified to be president if the need arises up from 50 two weeks ago,0

I m just offering my opinion and trying to discuss I am fully willing to listen to all sides and not make any judgments about who is or isn t trying to push their own point of view As I stated above the dramas wording seems to have been the stable version for quite some time I don t know whether that was before or after the consensus you are referring to but the wording was added more a little more than three years ago and as far as I can see I didn t check every edit during those three years of edits so I may be wrong has been pretty much unchanged since it was added So it s not hard at least for me to understand how some editors might question the change made by Joe2601 to wording that seems to have been stable for so long I m not saying that the edit was wrong I m just saying it probably should have been discussed after the first revert and almost definitely should have been discussed after the second revert Just my opinion,0

But in the end does it really matter if one page has a link that another doesn t Also since the anime and the manga seem to be radically different things sometimes a link may be applicable to one while not to the other The same reasoning goes for the wiki link The manga page doesn t need to have the infobox for the anime or the novel and vice versa The point is I don t think the ability to place the same thing on only three pages justifies the need for a template I hope you understand where I m coming from,0

I have added a new section critical of creationism For those unfamiliar with the recent history of this article there was an old version that I originally added that was edited to such an extent that it became fairly garbled and incoherant This section is probably in an early stage and some of the arguments need fleshing out in my opinion The basics I wanted to get are Creatinionism is not a theory backed up by or built upon scientific evidence It is unfalsifiable and violates the principle of parsimony It is a belief system that is often aggresively pursued by those people who are offended by the implications of the theory of evolution with regards to their own religious beliefs The evidence for evolution is overwhelming while I appreciate the evolution creationism section deals with this more thoroughly I think this point is so valid that it at least deserves a mention on this page while there is in fact no positive evidence for creationism What might be worth adding is more detail on evolutionary evidence without necessarily going into too great a depth simply because it has been dealt with elsewhere and also it might make sense to add some information about the attempts of militant creationists or more appropriately anti evolutionists to get creationism taught alongside real science in the science classroom If any other people wish to help me with this I would appreciate it,0

The style of writing in this article reminds me very much of the skewed reporting on sectarian killings in Northern Ireland where many murders attacks of catholics were reported as revenge or retaliatory but murders of protestants were always sectarian or terrorist attacks This article is disgraceful in that it describes all attacks following the riots as retalliation when it is not even known if that is the case Also if these attacks such as the stabbing of a white man and the threat of a sexual assault on two women he was with by Lebanese males can be considered revenge attacks then why were the attacks of the Lebanese men at the beach not revenge attacks in retalliation for the assault on the lifeguards At least one Australian media report I read had described the riots attacks on the beach in those terms The article also gives a misrepresentation of the chronology of events building upto the riots The protest did not begin with ethnically motivated mob confrontations It began with a protest by many people who did not attack innocent people There is no way this article is even close to neutral,0

Trek Into Darkness should be a noun phrase It describes a specific instance What happens when you put a verb and a noun together Darkness is a noun If you can put an article in front of it it should be a noun phrase right You can take a trek into darkness just like you can take a star trek into darkness just like you can take a trek into darkness in space All the variants appear to be a noun phrase It only becomes a verb phrase when you add the infinitive to to the beginning My example is A Civil War To Civil War I think the best way I have seen it described is Road Trip Into Wilderness It describes a specific Trip Into Wilderness Hey remember that one time when we took a trip into wilderness The reason I DONT think it is a verb phrase is because I don t see star as an adverb I suppose it could be an adverb but the dictionary doesn t list it as one Let s play a little substitution game Muppets in Space muppets are a noun Star Trek in Space Star Trek Into Darkness in Space Or when someone says Disney on ice Star as an adjective is roughly the same as in space I would also like to point out I think Star has ALWAYS been an adjective since the starwars startrek days It modify the wars trek noun to tell you what type of war trek it is A war of the star variety aka war in space The phrase star trek doesnt make sense to me if star is a noun If I said Waterfall Marathon you would think I meant waterfalls running I don t think Star s themselves can trek I think it works like the phrase Safari Adventure Safari is the type of adventure so it s an adjective Hmm the more I think about it the more right you seem If trek into darkness is a noun phrase trek must be a specific instance too and thus a noun It works as a command too I command you Trek Into Darkness right now Soooo if Trek Into Darkness is a verb phrase does Star become an adverb for the first time ever,0

Why is it written Czechia and not like Checkia What does the cz really stand for as a sound in english Preceding unsigned comment added by 16 47 25 April 2016 I think the section Czech Republic Etymology already discusses this point Thanks,0
For the record I erroneously referred to that revert as your doing by giving it a cursory glance therefore the mistake has less to do with malice about a previous edit I mentioned in the section I wrote in response to you several days ago you would see that I was over that little encounter shortly after it occured This was a mistake not a stirring of a pot I have little interest in getting into childish battles over the internet and I m sure the same goes for you Either way my mistake and I apologize,0

Additional note a decision has to be made whether to follow his own spelling of the name Muralidaran or what has been popularised Muralitharan At one point on the page we ve got a sentence saying His name is actually spelt Muttiah Muralidaran in which case there is absolutely no reason to have the rest of the article and the title of the page using Muralitharan,0
No Wikipedia is an encyclopedia that is supposed to be neutral with neutral meaning representing all POVs with the weight they are given in reliable sources With nearly no exceptions reliable sources say what happened was a massacre The use one line from one paper a paper that itself repeatedly calls it a massacre as the basis for questioning the countless other sources is not neutral,0

All of the articles are truly strong arguments FOR the renaming I must add that I fully agree with the renaming The whole name issue seems quite strange to me how do we name the situation in China suppression when we re talking about killing jailing without trial for years up to 3 or 4 I think for a single sentence containing the practice s name in the public or private sphere beatings in custody and tortures and who knows what else I don t put an emotional load in it but for me the name suppression just encyclopedically does not fit the content imagine you never heard about the persecution Now type Suppression of Falun Gong in the search box Have a look at the content table Well,0

I will not comment on your allegations you lied you abused references you after 5 6 month first in history made a compomise I can not believe that you re not some political extremist a simple comparison of our block logs indicates who is right However I would like to thank you for emphasizing that the link to S ndor Kostya s book indeed works It did not when I checked it earlier during the day Now it seems to be all right Therefore I reintroduced it to the article As to pan Slavism it was not the only or the main source of the Slovak national movement I hope the article now clarifies the differences between various groups in the movement,0

Anyone interested in the Charter of 1606 can find it on the internet here Under the English feudal system lands of non Christians were considered to not have legitimate governments and thus they were not sovereign states subject to Act of State doctrine According to the political philosophy of the day once the king claimed land for his kingdom divine right of kings gave James I divine authority to establish the law over that land hence the Virginia Charter Not saying it was morally right but legally it was the way it was until the Tenures Abolition Act of 1660 So really the disenfranchisement of indigenous rights was a function of the post reformational intellectual climate Do we want to say this or do we just assume that people know that early Virginia history is a product of the Jacobean era Peace,0

Guys without trying to come across as peacemaker I value Gabe s input to FAC just as I value Crisco s and Schro s I m not a lawyer but to use an analogy balancing precedent extant FAs with statute MOS can be tricky Of course the analogy falls down a bit because much of MOS isn t policy it s guidelines which don t carry quite the same weight and are open to more liberal interpretation I think Gabe that the emphasis on real world in the MOS is and should be taken as applying to how WP presents works of fiction as a whole not necessarily how the plot of a work within an article should be written Crisco s article taken as a whole applies the real world principle One section within that whole eschews real word perspective per the single work clause in the MOS plot summary guideline and IMO per common sense Where there s room for interpretation I would always try to respect the voice of the main editor s of an article in this case Crisco If someone wrote a plot summary in a fiction article and employed The novel begins and Crisco objected I think I would also say that there s not a black and white answer and that the main editor s position should be respected this principle applies to many areas such as citation formatting the number of paragraphs in a lead date format in US military articles etc etc and I try to apply it universally Cheers,0

edit conflict Bruce Please don t take content disputes to WP AN Also your personal attack there is noted Would you like a template warning too Now the section title was originally NPOV does NOT cover relaible sources and Bruce changed it soon thereafter to NPOV does NOT cover quotes from reliable sources which is a clear misunderstanding of how NPOV applies to article space Bruce is using this talk space as a club to hammer in polemical denouncements of Chick tracts with extremely biased language by saying it s OK if I took it as a direct quote from a RS I changed the section title to NPOV dispute because it is descriptive and unbiased There is no need for section titles to be overly long or detailed because the content is in the body of talk Section titles are there for a quick reference for those visiting the top of the page to skip down to the section they want,0

We can t always use not reliable sources as the convenient cop out or alibi against putting material that you may not personally LIKE to come out It becomes clear real soon that that s really what s going on here Because I do become perceptive Are you gonna say that Webster s Online Dictionary is so unreliable You re mentioning wordpress now though I mean yes it s true not all sources are as solid or reliable as others But the problem with your position is that Spurgeon said these clear things IN HIS OWN BOOKS To say that Spurgeon only believed Michael was a higer angel of higher status is a JOKE of an edit and completely inaccurate Of course many Baptists and Spurgeon supporters in supposedly reliable sources are gonna white wash that Because they don t like the idea of Spurgeon believing Jesus was Michael even in a Trinitarian sense But that s not what we re supposed to be doing or catering to unless you re personally in sympathy with covering up that fact Especially when those clear statements are in Spurgeon s own writings Wikipedia is not supposed to be about hiding or suppressing points or facts simply because some editors might find some of those fairly clear and supported facts a bit distasteful or surprising Clear unambiguous quotes from Spurgeon s own books where he calls Jesus Michael EXPLICITLY,0
There are currently 122 sources 64 of them are either US media or members of the GWOT coalition mostly CNN Reuters BBC There are maybe 25 sources which are official press releases from heads of state only used for World reaction This leaves a measly 33 sources from which can be subtracted other US allies in the invasion of Iraq You can see how there might be just a little bit of bias seeping into the article,0

Ugh So as far as my first initial search shows for works published between 1923 and 1963 in the US it is likely that the work is not copyrighted but possible if the copyright was renewed The problem is that determining whether or not it is copyrighted involves some very extensive research see note 3 on the policy page Unless there is some really pressing reason to use the material verbatim it sure seems to me that it s both better and easier to just summarize and properly cite the copyrighted material rather than copy it entirely If really necessary we can pull out a key quotation,0

As to the shooter s father I think his sentence can go or alternately we could move it under perpetrator since his comments are mainly about his son I do not object to including a single sentence on the pope although perhaps instead we could just refer to world religious leaders cite without specifically mentioning any particular one in text the Dalai Lama led a prayer in Washington for the victims and the Archbishop of Canterbury has a statement as well so if we included a quote from one but not the others I m sure someone could object and reasonably so,0

I realised further debate was pointless when you wrote When Naveh states the operational approach at its best he is not saying the operational approach at its most brilliant he saying it is the only thing that came close i e an operational method at best This came after your claim it was reasonable to cite Citino to support the statement the majority of historians have come to the conclusion it was not a new form of warfare invented by the German military but an old method of pursuing decisive battles using new technology when he makes no mention of the majority of historians and holds the opinion that the German doctrinal revolution brought about a new style of warfare that has had influence down to the present day Everybody is welcome to trawl through the NPOV section and draw their own conclusions,0

First of all Sopher99 let me advise you to read the whole article before you use a source The source about Qarah is either written by the rebels or by someone with no brain The Union also said the rebels had stormed the headquarters of the Republican Guard on Mount Qasioun which overlooks the capital Did you read this sentence or you missed that Now that is what I call a desperate propaganda If Qarah was retaken by rebels It would be a great victory for them and SOHR would have reported that and they are pro opp About Nabk the city is contested according to SOHR and many others there is fighting and yesterday it was reported that a rebel was killed by clashes in Nabk 1 rebel fighter was killed by clashes with regular forces 2 civilians 1 is a woman from the al Nabek city were killed the woman was killed by sniper shots and the man was killed under unknown circumstances Here is the report,0

The classical liberals varied rather widely on the extent to which the government ought to provide public goods paid for via taxation The position presented here that they opposed all but the most limited forms describes 20th 21st century people who identify as classical liberals but is much more problematic to apply as a generalization to earlier period classical liberals For example both Adam Smith and Thomas Jefferson were in favor of universal government provisioned public education Jefferson being particularly strongly in favor,0
I agree that portions of the document call into question the true motives behind the 2003 invasion of Iraq I also agree that the document contained sic no policy recommendations about Iraq I can do this because there is no contradiction here However I am not familiar with any reports that claim explicitly or implicitly that the document contains policy recommendations about Iraq and highly doubt that any exist Please read carefully as the distinction is subtle but important 00 59 2004 Aug 7 UTC,0

Y2kcrazyjoker4 and Cresix sorry do you have anything that isn t WP OR to support your good faith statements While an arena is a location the bands you mention do not fit the stylistic format described by the sub genre of arena rock And while there are classic rock stations if you say to a kid do you want to listen to some rock music and the kid responds in the affirmative and you trudge out Bread or any other classic rock they will immediately label it as such All words get their start somewhere Just because classic rock got its start as a radio format doesn t mean that the term doesn t define some specific elements common to a style of music That is what genres are The same goes for the term arena rock Just because no one has used your magic word genre or it s been expunged from the article doesn t mean it s not a genre Besides you two should both be aware of this wikipedia is not a reference I could just as easily state that about 75 of the genres listed on this article,0

Which is precisely the kind of attitude that lets bias prevail Also Andrew if any of the Lebanese attacks were responsive then couldn t the original attacks on the day of the riots also be labelled responsive Whatever word you choose still gives a level of motivation for Lebanese attacks which we don t know existed and fails to give the same motivation for the attacks against Lebanese men on the beach Again I go back to the situation in Northern Ireland A murder is a murder but when you choose to put your own slant on the logic of the criminals on the assumption that there is a distinction to be made you are basically engaging in mind reading assuming one act to be a brutal hate filled crime while giving a rationale to any crime that follows on the basis of what you believe was going on in the minds of the attackers Again this article is full of bias,0

Tony I think you seem to misunderstand the guidance around notability Article content does not need to be notable It just needs to be encyclopaedic Let me give you an example consider the article on Chelsea FC Chelsea wear blue kit they have a stadium they have a squad but none of that makes the Chelsea article notable What makes the Chelsea article notable is the fact that they are a Premier League club have a salubrious history and have won a few trophies But we dont just talk about the notable stuff in the article We also talk about the strip the stadium and the squad So the inspection stuff doesnt affect the notability of the school article one iota but it is commonly quoted in English school articles across the pedia Inspection reports are really good sources for generating content There is often good material in them Personally I would expect most of the good stuff in the reports to be used in the Education section of the article when we are finally allowed to write it Not that an Education section based on an Ofsted report would affect notability in any sense,0

The equalized image is strictly for better visualization of the subimage and to exacerbate the differences caused by quantizing for the simple reason that we have a harder time seeing minor luminosity changes If you want to completely change the entire page to reflect your new example then I guess I can t stop you Keep in mind that you ll have to recalculate everything and all the data has been on this page for a while and has been fairly stable Reworking the example will inevitably introduce errors and the cycle will have to repeat All because you want to cater to the lower denominator However I think it will backfire If you use a higher dynamic range image then your quantization will still be fairly small and with a higher dynamic range I really really doubt you re going to see the pixel value changes mostly because you can t do a histogram equalization to exacerbate the changes If you can easily tell the difference of 3 5 shades of gray then good for you But since you re catering to the lower denominator you ve just made it harder for people with not so awesome sight as you Personally I find it easier to change my understanding of a topic than to improve my eye sight I also think you re blowing this issue out of proportion Do you have any kind of evidence to support your position that mentioning histogram equalizing loses people I don t see it as obvious as you do I guess Visually comparing the images I imagine that most people would see the lighter shade of gray is now gleaming white and the darker shade of gray is a deep black and from that they ll get histogram equalization without having to know or care about what a histogram cdf or normalization is it makes the dark darker and the light lighter,0

This article has unfortunately been allowed to languish for some time what s good about it hasn t been particularly well organized or in some cases verified and a clearly contentious section called Controversy accounts for nearly half the text I d like to change that and I ve prepared an alternate version of this entry available in my user space here I happen to work with Time Inc so because of my potential conflict I will avoid moving my draft over for now I intend for this comment to serve as a request for an uninvolved editor to consider replacing the current article with my draft or something similar to it Most of what I have changed is not very controversial I ve located citations to verify accurate material in this entry and re organized the article structure to better reflect the shape of his public career More sensitive of course are the topics covered in the existing Controversy section Some of that could be an issue under the Biographies of living persons policy and I d be interested in another editor s opinion about that material but I ll punt on that for the moment The one topic for which I will offer a suggestion relates to the fourth and fifth paragraphs Specifically that topic is the early 2008 Time cover in which the border was changed to green and the famous Iwo Jima photograph was adapted for the issue s environmental theme You ll find it in the Managing editor of Time magazine section in my proposed draft I d very much appreciate anyone who takes the time to read through my draft and consider these changes If you have any questions or comments I m open to discussing any of them Here s hoping we can find consensus to bring this article closer in line with Wikipedia s guidelines Cheers,0

Bulgars also called Bulgarians were one of the three ethnic ancestors of modern Bulgarians the other two were Thracians and Slavs The origin and homeland of the Bulgarian tribes are still subjects of research generating many hypothesis and violent disputes They were mentioned for the first time in 354 AD by Anonymous Roman Chronograph as people living north of the Caucasus mountain and west of the Volga River Headed by their chieftan Vund they invaded Europe with the Huns about 370 AD and retreating with the Huns about 460 AD they resettled in the area north and east of the Sea of Azov Bulgar Vund or Utigur vh ndur Vanand is the name used by historians and geographers like Moses Horenaci Procopius Caesariensis and his continuators Agathias of Mirena Menander Protector and Theophylact Simocatta in the 6th century to refer the eastern branch of the Hunno Bulgars who were the successors of the Hunnic empire along the coasts of the Black Sea in Patria Onoguria The Huns Rome and the Birth of Europe 2013 Hyun Jin Kim page 57 After a period of chaos following Attila s death dualism again reasserted itself in the succession of Dengitzik and Ernak west and east respectively The successor to the Hunnic Empire in the east or rather probably the coninuation also featured two wings the Kutrigurs west and the Utigurs east ruled presumably by Ernak s descendants The late antique historians use the names of Huns Bulgars Kutrigurs and Utrigurs as interchangeable terms The Huns Rome and the Birth of Europe Hyun Jin Kim page 256 Thus in our sources the names Kutrigur Bulgar and Hun are used interchangeably and refer in all probability not to separate groups but one group Saatchi Early Mediaeval identity of the Bulgarians page 3 The early Byzantine texts use the names of Huns Bulgarians Kutrigurs and Utrigurs as interchangeable terms There the Bulgarians are represented as identical they are a part of Huns or at least have something common with them The khans Avtiochol and Irnik listed in the Nominalia of the Bulgarian khans today are identified with Attila and Ernach of the Hunno Bulgarian Loan Words in Slavic Antoaneta Granberg Introduction 2 the data are insufficient to clearly distinguish Huns Avars and Bulgars one from another REMARKS ON THE CHINESE BULGAR 2004 SANPING CHEN In fact contemporary European sources kept equating the Bulgars with the Huns At the very least the Hun Bulgar connection was much more tangible than the Hun Xiongnu identification History of the Later Roman Empire J B Bury The Kotrigurs who were a branch of the Hunnic race occupied the steppes of South Russia from the Don to the Dniester and were probably closely allied to the Bulgarians or Onogundurs the descendants of Attila s Huns who had their homes in Bessarabia and Walachia They were a formidable people and Justinian had long ago taken precautions to keep them in check in case they should threaten to attack the Empire though it was probably for the Roman cities of the Crimea Cherson and Bosporus that he feared rather than for the Danubian provinces As his policy on the Danube was to use the Lombards as a check on the Gepids so his policy in Scythia was to use another Hunnic people the Utigurs as a check on the Kotrigurs The Utigurs lived beyond the Don on the east of the Sea of Azov and Justinian cultivated their friendship by yearly gifts Encyclopedia of the Byzantine Empire Jennifer Lawler Utigurs Hunnic tribe that lived on the east steppes of Don related to the Bulgars 296 Walls and Linear Barriers Peter Spring In 460 the Huns split into the Onogurs Utigurs and Kotrigurs 199 history of the First Bulgarian Empire Book I THE CHILDREN OF THE HUNS Steven Runciman 5 On Attila s death his empire crumbled His people who had probably been only a conglomeration of kindred tribes that he had welded together divided again into these tribes and each went its own way One of these tribes was soon to be known as the Bulgars thus prompting some modern historians to coin the term Hunno Bulgars Pritsak 1982 pages 435 448 449 According to Procopius Agathias and Menander Utigurs and their relatives Kutrigurs were Huns they were dressed in the same way and had the same language O Maenchen Helfen The World of the Huns page 378 In one instance we are explicitly told that the Kutrigur and Utigur called Huns by Procopius Agathias and Menander were of the same stock dressed in the same way and had the same language Hunno Bulgarian Language 2008 Antoaneta Granberg G teborg University The Hunno Bulgarian language was formed on the Northern and Western borders of China in the 3rd 5th c BC The analysis of the loan words in Slavonic language shows the presence of direct influences of various language families Turkic Mongolian Chinese and Iranian The Huns and Proto Bulgarians spoke the same language different from all other barbarian languages When Turkic tribes appeared at the borders of the Chinese empire in the 6th c the Huns and Proto Bulgarians were no longer there It is important to note that Turkic does contain Hunno Bulgarian loans but that these were received through Chinese intermediary e g Hunnic ch eng li sky heaven was borrowed from Chinese as t ngri in Turkic The Hunno Bulgarian language exhibits non Turkic and non Altaic features Altaic has no initial consonant clusters while Hunno Bulgarian does Unlike Turkic and Mongolian Hunno Bulgarian language has no initial dental or velar spirants Unlike Turkic it has initial voiced b bagatur a title boyla a title Unlike Turkic Hunno Bulgarian has initial n which is also encountered in Mongolian Negun Nebul proper names In sum Hunno Bulgarian language has no consistent set of features that unite it with either Turkic or Mongolian Neither can it be related to Sino Tibetian languages because it obviously has no monosyllabic word structure Kutrigurs and Onogurs were in all likelihood identical with the Bulgars page 141 Many historians consider Utigurs and Kutrigurs as successors of the Hunnic empire in the east on the territory of modern day Ukraine where the Huns retreated after the death of Attila The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire Volume 4 Edward Gibbon page 537 And both Procopius and Agathias represent Kotrigurs and Utigurs as tribes of Huns There can be no doubt Kutrigurs Utigurs and Bulgars belong to the same race as the Huns of Attila and spoke tongues closely related were in fact Huns They had all been under Attila s dominion Huns Rome and the Birth of Europe 2013 Hyun Jin Kim page 57 page 138 page 140 141 page 254 That the Utigurs and Kutrigurs formed the two main wings of the same steppe confederacy is proved by the foundation legend told by Procopius regarding the ethnogenesis of the two tribal groupings He states that before the formation of both entities power in the steppe was concentrated in the hands of a single ruler presumably he is referring here to Ernak son of Attila who then divided the power empire between his two sons called Utigur and Kutrigur Justinian and Theodora Robert Browning page 160 The Huns of Attila and their descendants the Bulgars the Kutrigurs and the Utigurs were pastoral peoples of the steppe and semi desert lands of central Asia who had been driven westwards in search of new pastures by a combination of factors The progressive desiccation of their ancient home and in particular of the Tarim Basin reduced the grazing land available Menander Protector mentioned an Utigur leader in the latter 6th century called Sandilch Menandri Fragmenta Excerpta de legationibus Ed C de Boor Berolini 1903 p 170 Later these Bulgars of the Eurasian steppes had come under the control of the Western Turkic Kaghanate and were also known as Unogundur Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland 1971 Volume 3 page 459 Utigur and Unnugari are used as common synonyms for the same tribe Again the Unnugari are also called Unugunduri and Unungunduri In the early 7th century Khan Kubrat of the Dulo clan was ruler of the Unogundurs and the founder of Old Great Bulgaria Nisephorus Patriarcha Breviarium Ed C de Boor p 24 The Bulgar ancestors of the Utigurs represented the Pontic Kuban part of the Hun Empire and were ruled by descendants of Attila through his son Ernakh The Huns Rome and the Birth of Europe 2013 Hyun Jin Kim page 140 The same is likely to have been the case among the Utigurs and Kutrigurs who under Attilid rule had even more justification for claiming the imperial mantle of the Huns of Europe Who were the Huns Roman historians Themistius 317 390 Claudian 370 404 and later Procopius 500 560 called the Huns Massagetae The World of the Huns Otto Maenchen Helfen page 4 But considering that Themistius Claudian

page 41 paragraph 2 The basic color gamma of the depictions is a combination of red rose and white which is characteristic for the Bactrian Yuezhi Furthermore there is a definite symmetry of these two basic colors Thus if an individual has a red caftan then his shoes are also red but he has white trousers and a white belt and on the other hand if he has a white caftan and shoes the trousers and belt are red are almost identical to the traditional Bulgarian costumes made nowadays Genetic Research Although many scholars had posited that the Bulgars were Turkic tribes of Central Asia modern genetic research points to an affiliation with European and western Eurasian populations The phylogenetic analysis of ancient DNA samples shows that mtDNA haplogroups can be classified as European and

Eurasian origin for Ancient Proto Bulgarians D V Nesheva S Karachanak Yankova M Lari Y Yordanov A Galabov D Caramelli D Toncheva The Y Chromosome genetic tests suggest that a common paternal ancestry between the proto Bulgarians and the Altaic and Central Asian Turkic speaking populations either did not exist or was negligible Y Chromosome Diversity in Modern Bulgarians New Clues about Their Ancestry Sena Karachanak et al History According to Procopius there was a nation of Huns living to the east of the Sea of Azov and north of the Caucasus the king of these Huns had two sons Kutigur and Utigur The king referred by Procopius is most probably Ernak the third son of Attila After the death of the king the two sons divided the people into two tribes Analyzing the chronicles of the antique historians Vasil Zlatarski concludes that the name Bulgar was used for both tribes but in 6th century the tribal names were preferred by the Eastern Roman Empire due to the different policy it had toward these two tribes page 75 In the middle of 6th century the Emperor Justinian being attacked by the Kutrigurs under their leader Chinialus bribed their relatives the Utigurs led by Sandilch to attacked the Kutrigurs in the rear The resulting internecine war between the two tribes weakened them and made them vulnerable to the Avar attack shortly after that The Huns Rome and the Birth of Europe Hyun Jin Kim page 142 By 568CE some Kutrigurs groups came under the control of the Varchonites who were migrating to Pannonia and was also known as Avars The eastern Bulgar groups along the northern coasts of the Black sea the Utigurs were conquered by the Western Turkic Kaghanate who were violently opposed to the Pannonian Avars Due to civil war the Western Turks retreated back into Asia no later than 583 CE according to Zlatarski Kubrat s Utigurs defeated the Avars in alliance with Byzantium and reunited the Utigurs and Kutrigurs into a single Crimean Bulgar confederation in Patria Onoguria renamed as Old Great Bulgaria After Kubrat s death in 665AD his empire was dividedRunciman Book I The Children of the Huns page 16 17 when his appointed heir Batbayan submitted to the

Though I fear that such an addition to this lively debate will not change anyone s mind I feel obliged to point out that Alistair is correct in what he says Only what is shown onscreen is canon and thus only what is shown onscreen should be presented as canon It contradicts itself too much to add in yet more sources and count them as canon The Prometheus has two registry numbers the phaser count of the Galaxy class can t be agreed upon the size of the Defiant is wildly different depending on which episode you watch Tech manuals are nice for simms that want to fill in the gaps or fans that just want a bit more on that side but they don t count as canon Roddenberry himself said only what was shown onscreen was canon You make an interesting point about visual data onscreen Alyeska but it s ultimately unsound at least in the way you present it If Sisko says Deep Space Nine is five metres high whilst standing in front of an Okudagram that clearly shows a height of 5000m then the anomoly should be included in a Wikipedia article about the station But if Sisko says the station is 5000m tall and someone looking at a Galaxy class docked at one of the pylons estimates the scale and comes up with a figure of 6000m that s original research and not allowed here Your original standpoint is flawed as far as Wikipedia is concerned and that s evidenced as much by the way your argument has veered off course above and now addresses other matters as anything else On a Star Trek forum I d find your ideas interesting and I d be happy to discuss it but this is not the place and even if it were and even if we came to a consensus it would still not be canon and thus not for inclusion in the article There are instances where the mention of non canon information provided it is marked as such is warranted Jaeger s comments on the Akira design are such a case But to come up with your own stats via simplistic counts and non canon tech manuals and then pass the lot off as the way it is is wrong Even if you say on the article that the specs are partly conjecture it s still wrong Wikipedia is not the place for fan conjecture,0

I think someone tried to remove the misquoted scholar text so a full text of Patrilyak suggest pages 221 223 so Patrilyak text In May 1941 at a meeting in Krakow the leadership of Bandera s OUN faction adopted the program Struggle and action for OUN during the war Ukrainian which outlined the plans for activities at the onset of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union and the western territories of the Ukrainian SSR Section G of that document Orders for first days of the state living organization Ukrainian outline activity of the Bandera followers during summer 1941 In subsection of Policy Minority ordered Moskali Poles Jews are hostile for us and thus them must be exterminated in fight especially those who which would resist the regime deport them to their own lands importantly destroy their intelligentsia that may not be allowed into positions of power so called Polish peasants must be assimilated Jews must be isolated removed from governmental positions those who are deemed necessary may only work with an overseer Jews assimilation is not possible and Patrilyak suggest such instruction as orders to extermination of ethnical minorities Poles and Jews becouse they Poles and Jews Also he add information which actually added to article in addition to be a Poles they also interract with Soviet Authorities And at page 324 He conclude that the personnel of the Nachtigall Battalion have all reason to murder them becouse they are 1 Poles 2 Intelligentsia and as a last they interract with regime That s the full scholar text so addition a part of the text without a context need to be fixed to proper representation of the scholar text P S Same text appeared here at page 62 64 and notable to include as separate section may be name Bandera s OUN and Nachtigal participation would be intact Thank you,0

Or have a way to predict them Casting aside the need to define what one calls finite in some ways the sum of human behaviour is indeed finite but is it wholly finite Even if it is finite is anyone clever enough to gather all the data without disrupting outcomes through measurement find and map out all the variables and then show whether or not equations and algorithms can meaningfully model the sum outcome of human action behaviour So far the answer is no that aside from perhaps some dodgy and rough modeling of very small subsets this has not been done much less with Keynesian methodologies,0

Should the new data coming from the Van probes providing actual levels and types of radiation as well as the discovery of a third Van Allen Belt be incorporated into the section on environment We only talk about two belts not 3 Also with the discovery of the third belt would this increase the time required to traverse the belts and modify the flight path taken to maneuver around the belts Initially Wikipedia had 30 minutes one way then modified to 4 hours one way and now based on new discovery and speed and flight path X hours one way Until the new data can be processed and the correct total radiation exposure and time provided at minimum we should mention 3 Belts not 2 since NASA has provided this information,0

Malaysian Foreign Minister Yatim congratulated Minister Hyseni on the achievements of Kosovo and encouraged him for Kosovo to continue the path of democracy and social wellbeing He also pledged hi s Kosovar homologue that Malaysia will recognize Kosovo very soon and open the path for the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries As for the indirect quote that s all what a foreign minister can do after confidential talks Kosovo s foreign minister gives a summary of his talks with his Malaysian colleague in a way that cannot be misunderstood This is a valuable source of course if we are to include Serb press articles on third party s positions I still hope that we can agree on this It could be given in neutral form as Kosovo s foreign minister quoted his Malaysian homologue after talks etc,0
The article states that Fidesz emerged as the core of integrated right conservative nationalist forces the FIDESZ partly incorporated the Antall cult of inter war nostalgia and what the HDF stood for in their time and reawakened Hungarian nationalism in a somewhat extreme form which eventually backfired in 2002 The FIDESZ CP also drifted progressively to more radical nationalist policies rebuilding past images and symbolism tapping successfully the nationalist feelings I have recently added two other sources So there are now three articles published in the leading English speaking academic journals Anyone can check them The are all very explicit Fidesz is a nationalist party and it is not an insult It is just a correct description by political scientists,0

Subhash this is the last time I will remid you about WP NPA against me I have taken the time to read your past interactions with people and I see no improvement This article is too long the Godhra incident is difficult enough to chronicle If you include the Time article then someone will wish to include subsequent revisions to the theory of what happened Very soon it will again expand to dominate half the article and this article cannot afford that Please understand that a simple link to the Godhra article is sufficient along with a bare bones statement of what happened and what the disagreement is Also please consider that you are introducing far too many lengthy quotes that are statements of opinion and not of fact Further they are from individuals and not organisations and not individuals close to the playing out of affaris like Advani or Modi or even individuals considered mainstream opinionmakers like Stephen Cohen Unless you have a good defence of your edits they will be removed Finally please refrain from being aggressive on the talk page Your attempts at rudeness will not work with experienced editors as they merely make you appear immature and they certainly arent amusing which is how you have defended them in the past,0

Yours is a very common frustration for some Wikipedia editors We cannot add what seems obvious w out citation and that is infuriating at least it was to me when i started editing Way Back When the thing is Wikipedia is considered helpful because the opinions it has in the articles always belong to someone else Wikipedia as a whole should not be offering any original insight into any of its articles We already have the clowns over at Conservapedia thinking we are all leftist commies or whatever because of our supposed liberal slant I think that making sure we are keeping our own opinions as to what s important enough to write about within the rules of objective neutrality Regarding the points you mentioned I didn t include Hawkwoman because of any line she might have said I included her because she is one of the six heroes who were mind controlled into tearing up a planet that is a fairly large plot point that advances the series along As for the JLA being background characters in the show but not in the fictional universe in which they exist I say so what The series characters are sidekicks or former sidekicks but where they came from matters not as much as who they are during the series and where they are going If the Atom or whoever isn t doing something to advance the plot of the series along anything we right about him moves the focus off the Young Justice grouping This article is about Young Justice anything that doesn t immediately affect it doesn t belong in the article,0

If that s the case then most of this article should be removed For example under Causes of left handedness it states No one knows for certain why the human population is right handed dominant but a number of theories have been proposed So that bit should be removed There is nothing to back up the statement other than a bunch of theories only one of which actually has a supporting link The rest are superfluous supported only by statements like Apparently the Clan Kerr of Scotland built their castles with counter clockwise staircases so that a left handed swordsman would be better able to defend it However a 1993 study found no statistically significant increase in left handedness among people with the family name Kerr or Carr What study is this Where is the link If you re going to insist on links for my point you should insist on them for every point on the page The whole point of Wikipedia is to expand knowledge and then challenge it not remove inserted information and require it to be fully supported The community should decide if something is valid or relevant not the individual BST,0

Considering only a portion of their songs fall into this category I hardly think that is fair If that is how it works we need to go around all the articles about musicians and change their genre to fit their personal lives atheist rock Jewish Rock Buddhist Rock Golf Rock If a Christian grows a tomato is that tomato a Christian tomato or is it a tomato grown by a Christian The fact that they are Christians has nothing to do with the product of their music Christian Rock bands describe themselves as such and third party sources do as well I just don t understand Wikipedia any more I just don t understand why I ve had to sit here for weeks arguing about something so black and white I used to think wikipedia was all about using reliable third party sources and every single one of them say their genre is alternative rock metal or just plain rock not the first one lists their genre as Christian Rock Some of them say they are Christians and that is why there is the Christian Faith The only one who has a problem with the article in its current form is hoponpop Have none of you looked at his contributions He does this every where he goes He is WELL known for personal attacks vandalism sock puppetry etc etc etc He has been blocked for all of those things more than once,0

How is this kind of comment contributing to editing Wikipedia constructively May I direct J and other editors who engage in these kinds of comments to WP CIVIL and WP NPA with regard to such beligerent charges of arrogance Please stop the personal characterizations and follow WP AGF and WP NPA Thank you This talk page is for discussing making actual improvements to the article not for discussing editors In this case I really don t even understand J is talking about In no way do I expect readers to contact me to interpret the article no idea what J is referring to I expect readers to consult the sources as cited if they want more information not to consult me The reason for supplying reliable and verifiable sources all of which have been checked and verified is to provide guidance for those readers who actually do want to learn more about the subject cont To repeat The curator of Modern Literary Manuscripts the division room which houses The Harold Pinter Archive in the British Library is quoted in this article He published his comments in the official Harold Pinter Archive Cataloguing Blog a third party official British Library publication and the cataloguer Kate O Brien is the source of the process of cataloguing the Archive Those are among the most authoritative sources on the Archive and the citations to them are informative relevant pertinent and proper in this article on Pinter which is now an article about the life and work of a still recently deceased public figure and major literary author J s comments about the properly documented sourced passage that J removed earlier make no sense to me It has been properly restored Wikipedia policy is not to remove well sourced pertinent information due to personal whims and biases,0
The Kostopulos book is clearly controversial According to this source for example the book thesis is that it presents the Greeks overall as criminals and all the other people in the area as victims of the Greeks while this source on the left is praising it as debunking the mythology of the state ideological mechanisms The controversies presented in this book have not been accepted by mainstream academic critics That it was published in the Journal of Modern Greek Studies doesn t mean that the entire thesis of the author has been accepted as fact Also according to Research Gate the impact factor of the journal is currently zero meaning that this publication has no current academic impact let alone any standing in specialist historiography dealing with genocides Much more critical acceptance by mainstream genocide scholar historians is needed before the controversial facts presented by the author are fit to be showcased in this article Until such time as it is accepted by mainstream academics presenting these views in the article is WP UNDUE and WP POV Your edit warring to add this POV to the article should cease because it has become disruptive,0

Just a comment on this issueEditors on science articles myself included often forget how close we are to the material and how much lingo an average person would never understand take one look at and walk away to find a source they can comprehend I don t think we should dumb things down but we should lead the reader in gently to a lingo heavy article Use broad general easy to understand terms in the intro and then delve into specifics in the body Referring to a tuatara or crocodile or ostrich in the intro as a sauropsid serves no purpose other than to demonstrate how enlightened the editor is to cutting edge classification schemes and leaves the average reader completely in the dark Reptile is fine as an informal term just as fish is Use that in the intro text go into detail in the classification section That said a lot of the argument also smacks of original research or preferencing some papers over others A Google scholar search for tuatara reptile provides plenty of papers using the term reptile from the past few years so it clearly has not been completely abandoned in the technical lit and pretending it has here would be inappropriate,0

I don t know if I d call definitions from anarcho capitalists broad Here s Rothbard s definition I define anarchist society as one where there is no legal possibility for coercive aggression against the person or property of any individual Anarchists oppose the State because it has its very being in such aggression namely the expropriation of private property through taxation the coercive exclusion of other providers of defense service from its territory and all of the other depredations and coercions that are built upon these twin foci of invasions of individual rights from Society and State I don t think that s broad because it rules out anarcho communism as being anarchism,0

In removing the film from the above category I was mainly influenced by a strong impression that Lynch has long left his surrealist days behind There are some sequences in the film that could be said to show a surrealist influence but on the whole I found the film to be a narrative with two points of view and a smattering of surreal elements of a type that Lynch uses characteristically to heighten dramatic tension It s a judgement call I might as well have retained it on the basis of Lynch s earlier work,0

I have to disagree here While the sentences themselves are true in every way it is the manner in which they are presented that is problematic Namely they draw attention to the flavor side aspects of the game That s not a bad thing per se but as currently written it appears to be much more important than it is The gameplay section needs an overhaul Note When I say gameplay section I mean the stuff between Game play and Deck Construction For one thing it s badly written and I mean that purely objectively It s hard to understand even for me and I already know what it s talking about For someone who doesn t know the terms already I suspect it s pure gibberish Specifically The six types of cards aren t really relevant to understanding the basic of the game They are laid out in detail on the rules page they don t need more than a passing mention here The paragraph beginning with during each turn is a mess of long tangled sentences There is some important information there but it s lost in the jumble of keywords parentheses and conditionals The stack is very complex A large chunk of the rules page is devoted to explaining it I think everything that s discussed in this section merits being there The issue is the level of detail and manner of presenting Currently the material is badly presented and given what I consider too much detail The article should mention the stack and how it resolves timing issues they do not need to know the details of how it works That should be reserved for the Magic The Gathering rules article,0

We could use direct quotes from primary sources although that s not the kind of sourcing we re supposed to use in Wikipedia But if you read above a little more closely you ll see that the words that we would use from the primary sources would be no more intellectually stimulating I m sure you ve seen the quotes But here s a bit of Rush if you want it and here is Cain You seem to be contending that using the RS secondary sources is causing us to be less kind to the critics but the quotes will tell you that the source s characterization is an accurate reflection of the reality,0

Cherrypicking will do more harm than good because it will make this article appear less neutral All Wikipedia articles are to adhere to an apparent Neutral Point of View unless you want to undo the hard work may of us on the pro OWS side have conceded on the grounds to better our credibility as editors If we make this article blatantly biased it will be ineffective compared to the more cogent use of subtle bias Think about it from a perspective of how to peddle influence If we make the article seemingly biased then we have none,0

This article does read pretty much like an advertisement like the warning at the top of the page says Let me balance that by providing a first hand account of one person s unfortunate encounter with this very poorly behaved software I bought a new 2G Sandisk Cruze flash drive big mistake and plugged it in to my computer even bigger mistake The result was that 1 it registered itself as a cd rom device and 2 it immediately began installing and running software This is right out of the box and i did nothing other than plug it in to my usb port Some people might consider this about the same as getting a virus on your computer It s as if you walk in to Circuit City and say i d like to buy a virus for my computer and the clerk says here you go take this sandisk flash drive It s easy to install the virus just plug it in to your usb port and let it do the rest Thanks sandisk for foisting more intrusive obnoxious unpredictable and damaging software on the unsuspecting world This product should be taken off the market immediately,0
I m undecided as to the virtues of this Firstly the number of cites for Grove is going to be over a hundred by the end so that list of letters in the Notes section will go sideways until we ve got big time spacing problems Secondly the page numbers thing is a mess The cites to Viking and Orrey in particular are not so fantastic unless you get the page number At the moment you have to click down to get the cite and then go back up to get the page number What is more I m working from Grove Online so that needs to be made clear Personally I think that repetitive citing is actually better than this revision which is somewhat confused Deletion,0
there isn t a very good argument in favor of the Iridology article itself outside of the above It is a fringe science I have discussed it with a medical proffessional who knew of it and they seemed to find it humerous at best On the other hand yes your reference to the streets of london is a perfect explanation I d like to have an in depth article on every person living and dead Maybe even have a dna blueprint for alot of them I don t see why we should draw the line on fringe science so long as it is clear that is what they are Do you honestly think Waniek Co is unqualified a Iridologists How could anyone be Are their schools for this It isn t recognized as a medicine legally in the US and so I would assume no liscensing is necessary Is there a liscense for a Iridology in romania Honestly I prefer to get as much information as possible from as many sources as possible It is really best to require the accuser to present the evidence You accuse mr waniak of being unqualified but what is a qualified Iridologist A snake oil sales man A hypnotiost just what are the qualifications you d like to have proved Will mr waniak have to cure you of something I m already following the Iridology program minus the light in my eyes part as best as I can tell so maybe I m a qualified Iridologist Wiki is not paper is important to point out w silly extraneous articles like this one and deletionism is anti wiki because the point is to ad to repair rewrite produce more content Simply deleting alone is anti thetical You must ad content as well and prove your case with citations and facts Personally I d love to see it investigated I s their a romanian wikipedian who would be willing to look into mr waniak in person ring him up and examine his creditials We could all throw in and pay the fee s,0

There is no such claim that this is an image of the statue that inspired Moffat There is no such text in the article It is simply a free image of a relevant type statue to illustrate then to readers who may not be familiar with them The current caption simply identifies where that particular statue is located If the text is confusing and implies that then I would happily edit it except that Tag has threatened to file an AN3 Preceding unsigned comment added by You are supposed to avoid threaded discussion within sections like it clearly says at the top but whatever I know that I know that too Therefore it is pointless putting the picture of the statue in it is only there because in your opinion it looks like a Weeping Angel It s not a good lookalike especially given the position it s in The picture of an actual Weeping Angel already in the article is much better Since a unanimous but one consensus seems to be forming that the image should be removed I don t see the need to argue the point further with you Think about why I threatened to file an AN3 could it be anything to do with the fact that you ve been edit warring on the article and are on the verge of the 3RR,0

Latest clean copy Sustainability in a broad sense is the capacity to maintain a certain process or state indefinitely wrong words maintain and indefinitely although it is now you mean in this article now most frequently used in connection with biological and human systems says who In an ecological context sustainability can be defined as the ability of an ecosystem to maintain ecological processes functions biodiversity and productivity into the future 4 Why not just start out with that that is sourced to the U N and as a citation that is fine citations in articles leads are fine You are referencing the U N again and again here Could be a conflict of interest as editors involved in the U N movement could be biased no Sustainability has become a complex term that can be applied to almost every facet of life on Earth particularly the many different levels of biological organization such as wetlands prairies and forests and is expressed in human organization concepts such as ecovillages eco municipalities sustainable cities and human activities and disciplines such as sustainable agriculture sustainable architecture and renewable energy There is no such thing presently as sustainable cities so where does that come from Could someone name a sustainable city For humans to live sustainably the Earth s resources must be used at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally This is not actually a fact and means almost nothing in context However there is now clear scientific evidence that humanity is living unsustainably and that an unprecedented collective effort is needed to return keep human use of natural resources to within sustainable limits This leads magically into U N material then which should be in a separate area Since the 1980s through the influence of the United Nations global program for sustainable development the idea of human sustainability has become increasingly associated with the integration of economic social and environmental spheres to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs This is biased and not neutral and is not appropriate in this section Could these obvious things be corrected for starters Is it really a good idea to advertise the U N as the one to integrate economics social and environmental spheres That is pretty overtly an advert for an organization and not neutral in the least The article is not called Sustainability and the U N That would be a different article,0

Yes I think a vastly better approach would be to get more of the English wikipedia articles translated to other languages and then focus the front page on developments in highly populated English speaking nations which means doing a lot more of the U S And by the way to the person above who said the E U has a larger portion of trade than the U S um that s not exactly how we measure economic productivity By GDP standards the most relevant statistic for economic productivity there is the United States and then you end up having to go pretty far down to find the 2 country Japan I know the U S may be disliked around the world jealousy perhaps but no country rivals the U S or even comes close in matching its political economic military and other influence Sites like this overcompensate to accomodate these other nations Gambia had an election Great to hear that but I m pretty internationally educated and even I m going back to watch the NFL it s game day Gambians Let s get some serious U S coverage back on the cover and skip these second tier nations and developments no one gives a damn,0
You aren t the first and you won t be the last Many editors have come here attempting to change the direction of this article and few if any have made any headway towards the direction you seek That isn t to say we aren t building a consensus It s actually the opposite Consensus has been achieved again and again However there will always be editors who do not approve of the consensus simply because it does not align to their viewpoints So they come here again and again with tired arguments that have been defeated over and over again I don t know if I should classify you as on of those but the fact that you are a new account don t act like one and have only edited this talk page makes me skeptical You have yet to answer my question as to why we should include your proposed edits when they are covering something that is still developing I don t know what else to tell you other than to scour the talk pages and see that your argument aside from the recent portions has been proposed and rejected many times over,0

Is it the article you just linked Have you noticed that there are no quotes in it If this was not a personal Interview then I am wondering what her sources where espacially since that entire article contains basicly all the chinese anti Falun Gong Propaganda but states it as fact Have you noticed that all those articles on Rick Ross s site are based on sources from the Chinese state controlled media There are a lot of things in there that we actually BOTH know to be wrong When it comes to sources from western media it only selects the ones in line with the chinese site For example a while ago Rick Ross had a link to the a website about the Falun Gong exercises so that it appears as though he is also showing people what Falun Gong says Then that website started to also carry things about the perscution and had statements in there that contradict what the Chinese Government says about Falun Gong things that he stated as facts on his website He then immediatly removed this site and replaced it with a site about the exercises again If you don t belive me go the friends of Falun Gong website copy some of the statements by U S officials regarding the persecution paste them in an e mail to him and ask him why he hasn t mentioned any of that I ll bet you any amount that it won t take long until he takes you for a Falun Gong practitioner and starts cursing you in his replies cause that s what he did when I wrote him and pretty badly too,0

Really You want the rest of us to defend the current state of the article and present you with the sources which are already right there in the article if you d just freaking read it As someone who absolutely loves debates and logic both formal and informal and has practiced this love countless times over the years including being asked to participate in public debates often enough that others have seriously suggested I include professional speaker on my resume I like to think I might know a thing or two about debate tactics And this right here This is a ham handed attempt to try to force a group with a powerful argument into the defensive likely in preparation for an attempt at a Gish gallop rebuttal It s the sort of tactic which is a hallmark of debate positions that rely almost exclusively on rhetorical tricks and emotional appeals,0

Now here is the list of explanations for why most of the sentences I wrote spending 5days should be kept rather than new changes Probably I spend more time on the explanation than you on the edits I ll also restore my version which includes recent changes of other contributors again Why justify that something should not be changed when it is more reasonable to demand a justification that something of a version containing outcomes of discussion should be changed totally Stableness of an article is an aspect of a great article according to wikipedia I ve always included reasonable changes of other contributors You You just reverted alleged the other version of POV failed to explain why it should be POV reverted again alleged again failed to explain again Really fair Changes Why delete This article is about the computer game America s Army It is what America s Army is in one word a computer game It also explains that the article is about this game instead of the real army Is there a faster way of explaining it to the reader Why deleting that the game was developed by the US Army and some NPS scholars Should the reader be tricked into thinking the game was developed by some independent institute called MOVES Institute The MOVES institute is just a name for a little part of the army not a different organisation and might therefore mislead I count 4 links for US Army on one screen Please Make only links relevant to the context That s why I ve not linked many things that used to be The article was overlinked Why revert that too It makes no sense at all to write US then U S then US etc Keep consistency No matter if you like U S or US where s the difference except for two unnecessary dots they have the very same meaning and it s totally pointless to exchange these words if they don t need to be changed Never change for the sake of changing Should every reader who has read the article just exchange the words just because he loves dots Then comes the next one who hates dots and changes them and so on Same with the dates July 4 2002 or 4 July 2002 are changes that make no sense and are only preferences of one s own point of view Stableness belongs to the characteristic features of a great article not a train of thought Some subpage of wikipedia says US should be spelt U S while USA should be spelt USA That s why I changed them all to U S Why revert a jumble of US U S US US Why write Tactical shooter Tactical shooter is not a subgenre of first person shooter but a vague definition of sth that only MAY include fps It is more unknown than FPS and more vague You might just as well then use serious game computer game propaganda Advergame or whatever for genre So which can be used to keep genre NPOV If you click on the link to genre you see what only fits First person shooter Why did Bond not recognize that I almost forgot How long should this child s play continue Bond You re just faking support of versions that I disapprove of not because sth is wrong with them but because I disapprove of them You did not revert America s Army is the best simulation because although it is POV and would be deleted in the German version of this article within ONE minute you knew I wouldn t like the sentence Indeed you even reverted Ele s version twice But apart from that brilliant info box Bond Why delete AA It is the abbreviation for America s Army Even the cover proves that Why delete that Why delete propaganda and recruiting tool They re the reasons for the game the answer to WHY for the game It is without one of the most important questions a reader could have if not THE most important Excluding the question would without any doubt make the article completely biased I told you If you feel it doesn t fit propaganda read through the first two archives of the talk page and the definition of propaganda I m sure as hell not going to spend another 100kb of text for every new contributor one that issue If you like the term alleged case of use it for every picture you find for propaganda and see if this POV term Or how about this 911 is an alleged case of a human being You see how it sounds But without any points accusing me of POV twice and using it as an excuse to restore real POV Sorry but this hypocrisy inflames me Why delete the fact that it is fully financed by taxes It s nowhere else in the article Why mention the Navy in the opening paragraph Are they important AT ALL I put them to history where they will still get more space than the lack of relevance should actually allow Why delete the short description of realism in America s Army The game is a statement no matter if you regard AA as an accurate portrayal of reality or an intentional misrepresentation of reality It is only intended as a statement in the guise of a game not simply as a game no one would spend million of dollars for a game without any intention and the game s intention is delivering the statement Now a statement can only be between true and false What is true represents reality it is realistic it is truly What is untrue is unrealistic What is in truth is in reality I ve tried to keep the description of reality truth in America s Army fair Is it not Why only write inspired by CS I ve tried to describe the extremely close connection between the games months ago till the fact that the devs say they had the game actually taken as model convinced all Why play that down by words such as inspired Why put the game s popularity away It needs no section What should that section all include In the otherwise idiotic and uninformative IMO CS article that was called a good example of video game article popularity is also summarized in the first section Also your depiction of popularity neglected the contrast between the devs number of players and the real number of players Why delete the picture of training Compared to the only 2 3 hours a player would spend on training the multiplayer part is totally dominating this can be seen in the number of average honor 34 However I think the proportion still deserves a picture The picture taken depicts the first training level the level that really everyone who has played the game must have seen The article surely should not become a picture book but pictures enliven the text Just look at propaganda Beautiful isn t it It s certainly one of the reasons why it became a feautured article see its talk page Picture description Why did you revert Difference in depiction of the same player the left as the US Army and the left as OPFOR What s right then Such changes reverts just prove that you re ignoring what I edit Doesn t round start of the game s most often played map explain more than User interface during gameplay Why did you revert V I P Longer words such as USA should be written without dots in Wikipedia according to the same source that said US should be written with dots Why is the professor suddenly only of the NY University Should the reader be tricked into thinking it is just a student of the university Why did you delete the correct interpretation of what Galloway said Leaving out negative aspects of the US Army would be one way of intentional lack of realism What about the fidelty of content or the restricted code You didn t read through the text did you Why did you include the sentence about Hitler Was he crucial to understand the next sentence Anyway It further demonstrates the propaganda behind so I left it like it Why did you change that about military entertainment complex Three or four sources of academic articles included that aspect and isn t it logical,0

This reasoning you are putting forth is original research which is not allowed on Wikipedia It might pass on some fanwiki but unless you can find a reliable source that specifically calls Awakened Mewtwo a Forme then it should not be referred to as such on Wikipedia I ve shown sources in Japanese used in the article that refer to it simply as a form or in Japanese sugata rather than a Forme which in Japanese is Forumu And even then a Forme is still a form Using the latter terminology is more general and the former is still a silly little piece of game jargon that should only be used as part of the name of the form rather than making it something completely unique amongst forms Giratina has an alternate form called Origin Forme is a perfectly valid sentence There is no need to change form to Forme in that sentence So based on these two very valid reasons the word Forme should not be used in conjunction with discussing Awakened Mewtwo Unless it is revealed that Awakened Mewtwo gets some new unique name in Japan like My ts Kakusei Forumu then Forme can be used and even then it s not necessary to refer to Awakened Forme as an alternate Forme because that s just bad English due to the fact that Game Freak decided to go with the French word instead of the English word,0
The fact that you re right about the purpose of the talk page is entirely irrelevant it s off topic and we don t need to feed the vandals The idea that we should not remove comments like We need to add the fact that Mr Garlin was killed by a mountain lion this evening is laughable,0

As far as the outcome of Minkow s case goes that s not relevant to the subject of pyramid scheme allegations summarized in the lead Minkow was sued by USANA subsequent to the release of his report The court then ruled against USANA s claim that Minkow had defamed the company and the court never reached a final ruling on the remaining allegation of stock manipulation because the parties settled out of court and notably USANA paid Minkow s legal fees as part of the settlement they may have paid him more than that but as you know the full terms of the settlement were not disclosed The edits you proposed imply that Minkow was successfully sued for claiming that USANA was a pyramid scheme and that he then recanted his accusation as part of a court ordered ruling Nothing could be farther from the truth,0

On 25 August 2011 you changed the example in wiki link from Genghis Khan c 1162 August 1227 to Genghis Khan 1162 August 1227 I just noticed the change today There was apparently no discussion of the change and maybe few editors have noticed It leaves me a little confused though since the manual states a little further down Do not use a question mark for this function 1291 as this may imply to the reader an uncertainty on the part of Wikipedia editors rather than on the part of reliable historians You seem to believe that using a question mark for a probable year is a better way to handle the case where the year is a probable exact year while the use of c implies more inaccuracy so with c 1162 1160 1161 1163 and 1164 can be considered just about as likely as 1162 I understand where you are going with this I think but I doubt that the average reader or the average editor is going to understand How does a question mark in one case imply uncertainty on the part of Wikipedia editors and in the other case not imply that I also don t think a gnome who is cleaning up pages and sees born 1950 is going to know which way to go is it left over from an editor who wanted to express a vague year from the late 1940s or early 1950s and who had not read Do not use a question mark for this function or was it a carefully analyzed case of a probable year with a smaller chance that it is actually 1952 I d like to hear any further thoughts you have I m a little reluctant to start a discussion on wiki link because almost any discussion there can soon start to look like a fight at a hockey game I ll watch your talk page Cheers,0

I thought that was the best way to communicate there were claims made that had no reference I have not said people think the AP team is given better treatment I simply said that is how it looks to me and that there was at least two of the poster here who were like minded To understand that I asked you age and you got offended No one is trying to offend I am trying to slow things down to get consensus building not So I think we should cool down I have not been rude or uncivil but I am sorry if it appeared that way to you it was not my intention Really I take it your answer is the same and that s fine you an feel how you do I was offering a different point of view as one who went through this ansthe college football all america teams about 38 years of them,0

I think you mix up the role of the footnotes which is to be up to date Scholarly and the Further Reading which is to guide non expert readers Readers who are Ottoman Experts certainly do not need it But Wikipedia has a few hundred million readers we have to serve They want one or two readable books they can understand and appreciate without a grounding in historiography or linguistics They will not get them from experts I fear the statement that Academic historians can and do write books which are accessible to a general audience is refuted easily enough in the Ottoman case Ottoman historians have rarely stirred themselves to write for a general audience Finkel p xi and Those who have the temerity to jump into the Ottoman longue dur e waters are few and far between Aksan So who are the beautiful writers and thrilling story tellers you are recommending for the general reader,0

I know what it s computed from and what it originally was and that s not the argument and Imperial pound is almost meaningless there s more than one but avoirdupois is the one meant The point is that BMI is not a unit used to measure anything it is a heuristic to guide to a healthy body weight but it is imprecise the very thing that units of measurement must by definition not be One could devise a formula to estimate caffeine in an energy drink by the height and mass of the can but the resulting computation would still not be a unit of measurement,0

Using the yesterday s example of wiki link which you moved to wiki link The bot finds articles tagged afd by reading wiki link This gives only its current title wiki link It compares that with a list of afds transcluded on the daily log pages this gives only the old title Wikipedia Articles for deletion Highland High School It knows to read anything at an afd for the current title wiki link and if that s a redirect to check where it s going to Since the afd from the old title was moved to the new title it doesn t see a redirect but a full afd that so far as it knows isn t listed on a daily page so I have to stop check the histories and figure out what happened If you had instead created a redirect from wiki link to wiki link this wouldn t require human intervention,0

I agree with Tom harrison and Karanacs but I don t agree that using other encyclopedias as a template is the way to go Book sourcing needs to be increased as Karanacs mentions but in terms of history this event is still relatively recent so there is no reason to not use news sourcing if that is available Using webbased sourcing is helpful since it allows for greater ease of source checking by all and since the cites allow for parameters which displays in the refs when the news report was made and when it was cited it is easy to update or remove refs if they go dead,0

The non negotiable policy of NPOV is not as you say to list facts and be rigorously fair in representing all POV s in a NPOV manner Mainly the WP NPOV policy states that The neutral point of view is a means of dealing with conflicting views The policy requires that where there are or have been conflicting views these are fairly presented but not asserted All significant points of view are presented not just the most popular one It is not asserted that the most popular view or some sort of intermediate view among the different views is the correct one Readers are left to form their own opinions and that the article should fairly represent all significant viewpoints in proportion to the prominence of each Articles that compare views need not give minority views as much or as detailed a description as more popular views and may not include tiny minority views at all and We should not attempt to represent a dispute as if a view held by a small minority deserved as much attention as a majority view and views that are held by a tiny minority should not be represented except in articles devoted to those views To give undue weight to a significant minority view or to include a tiny minority view might be misleading as to the shape of the dispute As for your concern about the separate articles note that this article is what is called a summary article in which those sections that become too big to fit within the size limitations of about 50 Kb can be spinned off to their own articles if warranted FYI there is no such a thing in Wikipedia about ownership of articles Anybody is welcome to edit any article with the caveat that it is done withing the basic principles of the project I have placed some pointers for you in your talk page that may help you understand how this project works,0

Since I am kind of new I don t know Is it possible to mark a section rather than condemn the whole article to be non neutral Actually the proposition about breaking the article up into other pieces and or summarizing it might also remove this problem so that we would know what small portion is disputed How would we go about summarizing or breaking the article up into pieces Has this been done for any of the biographies here before,0
Hi I think it is encouraging that you seem willing to accept that there are mainstream scientists that consider Dianetics to be pseudoscience In particular it is clear from the article that the psychiatrists and the medical scientists that have independently evaluated auditing have found its claims to not be backed up by the scientific evidence You seem to be concerned that alternative points of view are not well explained I wonder at this In fact such points of view are already included in the article to wit that the promoters of dianetics believe that it is an alternative to these mainstream science works,0

Well soccer is not my favourite kind of footy but I think the person who wrote that passage is correct According to a quick count of the list on pp 100 102 of my battered Collins Concise Atlas of the World in 1984 there were about 50 countries in which English was an official language a figure which did not include the EU countries you mention Neither does it include countries like India and the Philippines where English is the de facto common language and football is soccer I wonder how many people realise that the Philippines has more English speakers than the UK does So it can safely be said that football is soccer in all but a handful of English speaking countries and also for the vast majority of English speakers NOBODY claims all the EU countries as English speaking all national languages of EU states except Irish are official languages English French and German are most commonly used for official business of the EU English speaking FIFA affiliates within the EU completely different things are England Scotland Wales Northern Ireland the Republic of Ireland Malta and Cyprus In most other EU countries the sport is referred to as e g Voetbal Fussball Boldspil Fotbal Football etc Apart from Calcio you may notice that all are literal translations of football or ball game but in any case they are in the local language not English Secondly the same paragraph seems to ignore the fact that Australian people use the term soccer and so do Irish people Depends where you are in each country Did you notice that the Australian Soccer Association changed its name to Football Federation Australia last January 1st No Because i m Australian and therefore don t follow the sport or call it football In the interests of clarity and because I hate to see existing posts broken up I ve just returned my last post and the preceding paragraph to the place where they they started My opinion for what it s worth is that the decision to use the name Football Federation Australia is misguided and probably futile as it flies in the face of at least 130 years of football meaning either rugby or Aussie rules Probably less than 10 of the population mean soccer when they say football and while popularity of the sport may increase I think its hard to see use of the word changing,0

That the Apollo hoax theory fits the pattern of other conspiracy theories a term which you don t like but it fits like a glove And while it is possible that there was more than one shooter in Dealey Plaza there is no definitive proof of it One of the cornerstones of the JFK consipiracists was that Oswald was not a good enough marksman to have fired 3 shots in 6 seconds First he was a good marksman And second the six seconds start with the first shot so technically he only had to fire two shots in six seconds Etc Etc The JFK story is pretty much off the conspiracist radar anymore because too much time has passed and nothing new has emerged and JFK remains dead although one theory postulated that he had survived and was in a vegetative state once the autopsy photos were made public it pretty well put that one to rest However the Apollo story remains alive It will die except in the minds of a handful of hard core doubters when and if we return to the moon which will require funding and also a practical reason to go other than to prove that the Apollo program happened which would be a collosal waste of our tax dollars,0

You clearly don t seem to be getting the point regarding edit warring You ve been blocked twice now once for edit warring and once for continuing to edit war immediately after your block finished Regardless of whether or not you think that everything that happened after you got blocked was either wrong or reverted restoring content that got you blocked so soon after your block expired is at best unwise That you may have changed a couple of things slightly is of little consequence what you are doing is still considered edit warring and this opinion is supported by the fact that multiple editors have previously reverted the edits that you continue to make If you want these edits to remain in the article you need to discuss the issue on the article s talk page and not simply come back time after time restoring disputed content If you don t discuss the blocks will get longer until they reach forever As you were told don t edit war,0

That s not a very constructive revert you seem to think admins don t bother to read the thread but will just close according to their own devices without understanding what they are on about Of course the admin is going to do more than just close with no consensus or consensus they are as always going to read the whole thread and come to a decision based on the strength of the arguments Having you begging them to close it the way you want it closed looks as desparate as the thread above about vote counting By the way the disconnect between claiming I hatted the thread for no apparent reason then repeating the reason I gave looks a bit silly,0

I really don t care about what you think about my state of mind I gave my reasons about opposing this insertion As to your comment that I have not attached any sources or policies well that can be easily remedied Although I d like to point out this is a bit childish but then again that is my personal emotional opinion about this childish and ridiculous edit war you have started Here are the relevant policies and sources This is not a notable event Checkpoints are setup in Pakistan All the time Portraying this as a special event gives undue weight and distorts the event You will go to this page to read that Even when an individual is notable not all events they are involved in are For example news reporting about celebrities and sports figures can be very frequent and cover a lot of trivia but using all these sources would lead to over detailed articles that look like a diary Not every match played goal scored or hand shaken is significant enough to be included in the biography of a person You can also click here to read that according to policy Routine kinds of news events including most crimes accidents deaths celebrity or political news shock news stories lacking lasting value such as water cooler stories and viral phenomena whether or not tragic or widely reported at the time are usually not notable unless something further gives them additional enduring significance This event happened more than 2 years ago in a 17 year timeline of events Calling it RECENT is beyond ridiculous the article cited was written in early 2013 and even then the writer says that this event occurred recently not that the event occurred yesterday or today Therefore the outer margin can be almost mid 2012 I ll just leave it upto you to figure this one out This may get your neural juices flowing We do not add day to day occurrences in any article as far as I know this is just a day to day occurrence This clearly states that If you read the article by Mr Walsh you will see that he has given more than a dozen statements by different people concerning Hafiz I will leave this up to you too seeing that we both can read english and the source is clearly accessible to you Having cleared that up I d like to say that may have compromised out of courtesy as there were only two of you I m sure he will be able to re evaluate the insertion now that I have pointed out its ridiculousness Lets see what he says and go on from there,0

Comment I have seen people banter that my suggested move is disruptive Well I first saw the thread at ANI a few days ago and had never been involved In good faith I read through all of the talk page history and the subpage of spelling history and never saw the Ngram results brought up Seeing that as a clear and easy to interpret result I brought it here with a move request thinking this should make matters easier to decide Like Boing Said Zebedee states in the thread above I d like to see the matter settled once and for all so everyone can move on I edit across articles of different engvars all the time with no problem For me this isn t about national preferences no matter how others try to make it so I think people need to pack away their bad faith that I was doing something disruptive Good block on PBS,0
Thanks for the clarity Yes I ve realized that I previously got overly happy with the power of what can be done here and I thereby did some things which are often usually frowned upon here without realizing that I was doing anything wrong It s good that we have the processes for reviewing the work of peers on here so that the founding principles of this place can be followed That said I think there should be a delineation between different types of users on Wikipedia Or perhaps within a user s space there could be separate areas based upon the type of encyclopedia use being attempted by the user since there certainly are other ways of using an encyclopedia If the only way to use it was to write it what would be the point I think readers and studiers should also be considered as valid users and have a welcome place here in Wikipedia which is so great of a place that I think it shouldn t be exclusive My opinion,0
The chapter you provided and another 189 17 does imply that his last name is Hirako it s hard to tell for sure since Hirako would be a much more likely Japanese first name and saying that Hirako is a last name is like saying that Yamamoto is a first name However I will for now accept the manga as proof because it does always use FN GN I will therefore edit the articles and move them accordingly However please do not provide fansites as evidence if we ever have another argument because they are quite unreliable Also please register an account and sign your comments Y Y,0

2011 Chinese protests 2011 Chinese Jasmine gatherings The numbers of protestors estimated by foreign journalists for the first 3 Sundays have been small but the numbers of foreign journalists gathering have been significant and the numbers of police gathering and beating and arresting journalists and strollers suspected of casually walking in a politically provocative fashion have been even more significant The proposed new name from discussion on the talk page is intended to be a non judgmental descriptive title where Jasmine is the name used by protest organisers and media and apparently one senior PRC official If the proposal is accepted the lead would need to disambiguate in explaining that the article is not about the literal gathering of a flower The J is capitalised since it refers to the Western media s usage of the proper noun Jasmine Revolution regarding the Sidi Bouzid Revolt Naming,0

Okay how is labeling each game with an independently verifiable source what I called original research immature You are engaging in an edit war and your revert of a legitimate edit calling it vandalism is both an abuse of the term and a violation of wiki etiquette If I am guilty of anything it is poor word choice Original research to me meant going out and finding articles by college football historians and writers in an attempt to make sure that the list of games were in fact legitimately listed I don t see how you are claiming NPOV when you just reverted a legitimate edit with footnote on every single game listed bask to one that does not possess any at all,0

I copied this from my talk page Hi BMK Regarding your reversion of my recent IP edit adding a parenthetical to The Jazz Singer My WP editing philosophy is that I don t feel much obliged to cite a source when correcting an error in material that cites no sources and the affected paragraph is entirely and perniciously unsourced It includes the song fragments in question in a mini catalog of numerous synchronized singing sequences which is misleading at best My source in fact is the film itself in articles about films readily available on home video perfectly acceptable per WP the last I heard and a viewing will make the lack of lip synchrony in those bits patently obvious to anyone Folks seeing the film for the first time must have wondered if that was all the much touted Vitaphone was going to add to the experience until the first of the live recorded sequences began and made matters clear To anyone familiar with the contemporary recording technology and scoring procedure it will also be clear that the vocal is of a piece with the background score and was therefore recorded at the time the finished footage was scored i e the wild vocal was post dubbed The parenthetical disclaimer was an antidote to the misleading inclusion of those bits An alternative approach more heavy handed than my simple addition but probably preferable would be to delete Two popular tunes are performed by the young Jakie Rabinowitz the future Jazz Singer and accordingly replace the following his with Jakie s You added to the article these song fragments are post dubbed and not lip synchronous That is a positive statement of fact and as such should be verifiable if true If it is not verified by being sourced it is editorial analysis and thus runs afoul of WP OR The revert was good OK then I ll try following my own suggestion above and simply excise the misleading portion of the preexisting unsourced positive statement of fact which like my condemned parenthetical is best verified or debunked by referring to the same highly reliable source the film itself No technical expertise or editorial analysis is required to see that the juvenile vocalizing is not at all lip synchronous it s about as blatantly obvious as a cut or a fade out No OR there just plain old reporting Nope however blatant you think it is it s analysis or interpretation and that s WP OR Whether post dubbed or lip synched or sung live to the camera the song is still performed by the character and therefore your removal which I have reverted is incorrect and entirely WP POINTy,0
Sorry maybe I just wasn t clear I at least I can t speak for the IP editor beyond what is in xyr edit summary object to the following sentences Published by Eichi Shuppan Inc from January 2007 and sold in convenience stores and mainstream bookstores across Japan the one off glossy 128 page magazine devoted over 100 photographs numerous articles and manga style comic strips to highlight alleged crimes committed by foreigners in an effort to broaden the debate and take up a contemporary problem according to the publisher and Upon reviewing the matter Japan s third largest convenience store chain pulled the magazine from its shelves citing the publication s inappropriate racial expressions 26 Eichi Shuppan Inc editor Shigeki Saka defended the magazine arguing that it was not racist 27 Responding to his critics in Metropolis Magazine Saka feared for his life stating that he had been subject to a campaign of harassment received emails issuing death threats and that an army of bloggers had bullied Family Mart convenience stores into removing Gaijin Hanzai Ura Fairu from their shelves decid ing for everyone else that this book is so dangerous that it cannot be read 28 Responding to Saka s exceptional and spirited defense I don t like the continuation of that last sentence though I could perhaps live with it The problem with all of that material is that it isn t about Debito Arudou It s about the book not about Arudou s reaction to it That information is in Ky gaku no Gaijin Hanzai Ura File Gaijin Hanzai Hakusho 2007 where it belongs Putting it here is definitely WP UNDUE because it s including information only tangentially related to the subject of the article and borderline coatracking because it s attempting to use this article as a vessel to further Arudou s opinions about the book I request that you self revert I see that you are new to Wikipedia at least under this named account and so may understand but once you are reverted by multiple people it is time to stop reverting yourself and go to the talk page The rule is not start a discussion on the talk page but keep reverting anyway Furthermore you re also misunderstanding our rules about verifying info Just because a statement is verified i e supported by a reliable source does not mean it belongs in every single article that is somewhat related to the topic,0

Okay was kind enough to let us know about the official Wiki policy toward external links which is to follow this style guide WP EL My reactions to the guide follow These are my first thoughts not entrenched positions Under Occasionally Acceptable Links Note fanlistings are generally not informative and should not ordinarily be included I agree with this statement External sites can possibly violate copyright Linking to copyrighted works is usually not a problem as long as you have made a reasonable effort to determine that the page in question is not violating someone else s copyright If it is please do not link to the page Whether such a link is contributory infringement is currently being debated in the courts but in any case linking to a page that illegally distributes someone else s work sheds a bad light on us see Wikipedia Copyrights and in particular Contributors rights and obligations I doubt that any Olbermann fan site out there isn t using at least one image without express permission Let him without sin cast the first stone Under Links to Normally Avoid Any site that contains factually inaccurate material or unverified original research unless it is the official site of the article s subject or it is a notable proponent of a point of view in an article with multiple points of view See WP RS for further information on this guideline I think that OW passes this test because it is a proponent of one of the POVs Links that are added to promote a site See External link spamming It s a given that being listed here DOES promote a site The problem is if the link is ONLY here to promote a site and not to provide any value to the Wikipedia page That is exactly the kind of thing we need to discuss on a link by link basis A website that you own or maintain unless it is the official site of the subject of the article If it is relevant and informative mention it as a possible link on the talk page and wait for someone else to include it or include the information directly in the article Okay we all know that RCox owns OW I think it does have a place in the article so I will move for its inclusion in External Links Blogs social networking sites such as MySpace and forums should generally not be linked to Although there are exceptions such as when the article is about or closely related to the website itself or if the website is of particularly high standard Hmm forums KO o is primarily a forum site but it is very narrowly focused on the topic of this article Keith Olbermann I agree with other editors that the site owner jumped the gun on adding it in when it was still a zygote but it appears to have grown into a reasonably sized community since then I also think that the Democratic Underground should be considered for inclusion although access is somewhat restricted by donations which violates another part of the WP EL guide Sites that require payment to view the relevant content,0
There has been edit warring by a specific editor to add the view of a non expert in the article without consensus The view of a non expert is WP UNDUE and does not belong in this article in any section let alone in the political reaction section This non expert has also been heavily criticised by many others for his views But in the rush to add this UNDUE material to the article no mention of the widespread critical reaction to his views is made This is an unhelpful edit and the edit warring to support it must stop,0

Bullshit That s not how consensus works Consensus is not unanimity and the fact that there are a small group of editors who take a dim view of snopes doesn t make factual statements like widely known untrue Nor does it change the fact that widely known is not puffery or even weaselly Also urbanlegends com was a repository of collected legends that just happened to contain some debunkings many of which were done by the Mikkelsons and cathouse org was a general interest site that had a section about urban legends Also I m pretty sure both of those were started after 1994 I never even heard of cathouse org until 97 and I ve been on the internet since Mosaic was released,1

I agree with Ashmoo and that identikit image is out of place here This is supposed to be an encyclopaedia not Crimestoppers or Vigilante Watch Would you be equally blas if the article also had a rogues gallery of the 16 odd Anglo individuals wanted in connection with the events whose photos were widely circulated for much the same reason ie encouraging the public to make them known to authorities Likewise these individuals according to the accounts leastways are alleged many now I believe have now been charged convicted to have participated in violent affray and assault for no other reason than the victims appeared to be of Lebanese or Middle Eastern descent,0
Erm I can understand why you might take umbrage with numbers 1 3 and I apologise for any incivility or offense caused I will post to Hipocrite s talk page too But what on earth was wrong with my edit number 4 I tried and failed to informally mediate between two parties and was sad to have failed and even more sad that one then decided to quit the project though it seems he s back And finally can the erroneous and offensive reference to Likudnik please be removed now How many times do I have to ask Even if you think you re right it adds nothing to the gist of the main issue which is that the OP is not defining what a Zionist is,0

Nicely done At some point I think we ll want to specify that in addition to those RCT s a lot of sec sources find the same thing sham true as well as indicating there are a few that don t like Vickers quoted above I m sorry Vzaak if my reluctance to cite these RCT s seemed tendentious We talk a lot about efficacy in the lede and saying sham true is the exact same thing as saying no efficacy which a lot of sources that we cite find to be the case therefore I was and remain unsure about why sham needs to be in the lede at all but this compromise is fine If I really were being tendentious I wouldn t suggest using even better MEDRS s to reference sham e g the sec sources you can find in Colquhoun Novella editorial,0

You are right Friedman does not know everything He does however know certain things which parecon like many other alteratives to the market deny will not work He knows hoe they conflate misrepresent deny certain aspects of the market For example this idea that comittees can decide what to produce how much to produce and who gets what is produced more effeciently than the market is NOT new to parecon Friedman and many others deal with this with some frequency and explain how the market is best at distributing goods and services and how it is better able to deliver the most diverse set of resources while alternatives such as the one discribed here only provide what the majority or those in power want Take for example the auto market Under the market economy we have cars like the MR 2 Spyder An inexpensive sports convertable that only sees a production of less than 20 000 worldwide Toyota is also barely profitable at making it In comparison with their Camry which they produce millions of the MR2 is nothing yet it is still produced Alternatives such as the parecon WILL NOT produce a MR2 because the minority who desires a rear wheel drive rear engine light quicky spartan sporty cheap convertable is significantly small to NOT be noticed by some voting board The market thanks to the information contained in prices picks up on their wants and the good is produced Friedman deals with this extensivly parecon is half baked and not original he does not have to deal with these alternatives one on one Get real,0

Hi Once an article has been nominated for deletion you cannot remove the AfD notice from the page The process will continue with or without the tag but without it many other editors those who don t frequent the AfD discussions would be unaware that the article has been nominated and thus they won t be aware that the debate is occurring In this case I don t think that there is anything to worry about as I m aware that the subject is notable and I ll assist with some references to help get it through AfD I d be very surprised if consensus was to delete Nevertheless it is important that the tag stays present if only so that others can help with teh article and because continued deletion will probably result in a block for a wiki link violation,0

Well I disagree with you but that is not relevant as our personal opinions shouldn t impact the article All maps I ve seen point to higher concentrations of light features in the north eastern sections Friuli Veneto Istria The north west seems on par with most of the remaining central parts see the map on brunet for example As for the Cavalli Sforza reference it does not at all support the statement it purported to support in effect a red herring If you can cite the exact pages I couldn t find any feel free to add whatever it supports back in,0
Sources may not be online it is not an excuse to delete content I did not add it in first place If you want a change to sourced content the burden is on you I followed your contributions after noticing your strong bias that is all,0
Literature it looks like you are misrepresenting what I am saying First I never said that you shouldn t use the Italian review You can and I would not complain It just does not say that much I am referring to the content of the article not towards you My response was to defend myself against your accusation that I am not a NPOV editor that was all No offense was intended to you You have removed that I have removed I just have slightly greater standards for evidence by the looks of it You say that I am using case reports for epidemiological Would ask that you show me were I did this You say I am using a biased selection of source What I did was a pubmed search and pulled up the ffirst 6 reviews Cheers email,0
Behnam removed neutral POV cited material and made very clearly false OR claims that South Asia and Southern Asia Isn t deleting non controversial cited information vandalism People got in trouble for removing Afghanistan and Iran from the South Asia page in the past why shouldn t he she,0
Then discuss it on the article talk page and do not slap a bunch of templates on an article because you disagree with it in some respect I don t care about the dispute and have no opinion on it I only reverted your edit and warned you because your edit was disruptive Most editors would agree that even five maintenance templates is excessive Furthermore I am not solely referring to that tagging incident Please ensure that you are using templates correctly in general external link for instance was a wholly incorrect use of the template Thanks,0

I have re inserted the Scozzafava candidacy in the election box and take great issue with an assertion that Ms Scozzafava is in any position to withdraw her nomination at this stage of the election Her name will appear on the ballot she can will garner legitimate votes and remains politically active in her support for the democratic candidate She can however certainly suspend her campaign which has been accurately recorded and cited in the article,0
And now done All polishing of my efforts will be gratefully received I m hoping the page is now a proper B class but that ain t for me to say,0
I changed the pink to red in response to the above comment and it is indeed much more readable,0
Yes it does sound familiar I just took a second to look at point 8 again the section is about the 28 world series not the 26 series so it is as far as i can tell correct,0
I cannot vouche for whether this user changed it or not but I can speak on behalf of well the article You have to understand that the section was getting overrun with a ton of references that weren t really references IE just because something looks or sounds like something doesn t really make it a reference and with several of them could easily have just been a coincidence The first assumption should be made that the reference was irrelevant to the article and be deleted After that it should be cited and then put back in as a true reference and not This weapon looked similar to a weapon in this game If it can t be referenced it can t be included and the majority of those points in the article could not be referenced and as thus were considered original research and had to be deleted If it can be cited go ahead and put it back in If not don t Well that was lenghty but I hope you got my point,0
Yes MONGO we would like to add mention of the MOLTEN METAL You and others have repeatedly denied the existance of molten metal at WTC and have used every excuse in the book to keep it out MONGO why don t you give us a promise not to remove mention of MOLTEN METAL,0

Again as I said then many of these incidents themselves should not have existed in this article The comment by French Muslim leader sourced to IHT is a general response to allegations of Rising antiSemitism in France which is mentioned in the lead of this article itself Then it is only fair to include what they have to say in response,0
Yep that s about all it is Your personal belief See updated discussion on AN,0
TrueHeart s response is precisely what I am talking about passive aggressive bullshit that I d rather avoid Look you asked me a question I answered it so get the eff off my back Coming at me with both barrels and accusing me of using snark which I didn t use along with the aggressive tone is uncalled for What I have little patience for is editors who use talk pages for trolling and then go in for the kill when someone like me is stupid enough to think answering honestly is the right thing to do Gawd,1
Well whatever but aside from that I ll have you know yeah I did make a grammar error submission on one edit last night when I was skipping through the page not checking back Big deal That s only happened like just that time Aside from which your claims that I generalize something as useless as rock when they re a metal band never happened except for Opeth being that they don t play just metal but progressive rock also Don t try to put the blame on me doing something wrong when there s a clear reason for it,0

I don t expect this to be perfect I have tried my best to rewrite a section as best I can I have retained the entire body of information removed jargon made it easier to understand Please let me know if you have any problems with what I have written and I will attempt to fix it If it seems okay may I request it be added to the primary page Jehovah s Witnesses believe their practices are similar to those of first century Christianity 124 Teachings of Jehovah s Witnesses are established by the Governing Body Members of the body interpret and attempt to apply scripture 46 125 126 The Watch Tower Society does not issue any single document of faith but instead beliefs come from a collection of its publications and teachings 127 Its publications teach that refinements in teaching result from a process of coming to new understandings as God gradually reveals his will and purpose 128 129 130 131 and that new knowledge 132 results from the application of reason and study 133 the guidance of the holy spirit and spiritual guidance 134 The Society also teaches that members of the Governing Body are helped by the holy spirit to understand scripture which are then considered by the Governing Body as a whole before final decision 135 The religion s leadership rejects direct divine inspiration and 136 Instead divine guidance comes from understanding God s word 137 138 139 The entire Protestant canon of scripture is considered the inspired inerrant word of God 140 Jehovah s Witnesses consider the Bible to be scientifically and historically compatible 141 While accepting that some parts are literal while others parts as symbolic 142 The Bible is consider to be the foundation and structure for all their beliefs 143 Sociologist Andrew Holden s ethnographic study of the religion concluded that pronouncements of the Governing Body through Watch Tower Society publications carry almost as much weight as the Bible 144 Regular personal Bible reading and self education is frequently recommended Witnesses are discouraged from formulating private ideas reached through Bible research contradictory to teachings of the Watch Tower s publications and are advised to avoid reading other potentially misleading religious material 145 146 147 Adherents are told to have complete confidence in the leadership avoid skepticism about what is taught in the Watch Tower Society s literature and not advocate or insist on personal opinions or harbor private ideas when it comes to Bible understanding 148 149 150 151 The religion makes no provision for members to contribute or ratify primary teachings 152 and all Witnesses are asked to work with the organization rather than against 153,0

I do grasp OceanKat but was wondering why you hadnt mentioned the 2006 Annual National being listed prior to it actually happening I take it that you either missed it or hadnt mentioned it intentionally either way it is a done deal at this point As to the calendars I do understand because I help maintain several and for valid reason those calendars are moderated with various focalizers having access where the general public does not Regardless I would like to hear what criteria you would find acceptable for inclusions into the Alternative Rainbow Section should we agree on that point Likewise if you would like to work on that together in a sandbox off in the distance I would welcome working with you on such a project Let me know what your ideas are shine Lookingheart,0

I have heard and I don t know if it is true or not that MOST doctors who had knowledge of Terri said she was NOT PVS That would be what the Schindler blogs would be reporting yes yet roughly 2 thirds of the doctors who opined one way or another said Terri WASN T pvs lemme see you wouldn t happen to be including the 3 dozen or so doctors who saw the 4 5 minutes of video from the Schindlers and signed affidavits would it See most of those doctors don t actually say Terri is not PVS What they actually say is Terri appears to be responding and more tests should be done that isn t the same as saying Terri is not PVS Greer also mentions that some of the affidavits suggest that various specific tests ought to be tried but those tests had already been tried therefore revealing that the doctors who signed some of those affidavits didn t even know Terri s medical history A bunch of doctors suggested the fMRI but they also said that fMRI is an experimental procedure that ought to be conducted in a university setting as part of their research not as part of a medical diagnosis So while I m sure you would eagerly include every single doctor that the Schindlers managed to con with their 4 5 minutes of CGI video the affidavits actually reflect how little the doctors actually knew of Terri s history 3 July 2005 01 53 UTC,0

I first thought of splitting according to some non numerical scheme e g Classical Period Middle Ages Modern Times but this has the problem of disputed starting ending times and it only applies to European history really A problem is the large number of pages linking to this page usually referring to a specific part of it Each link would have to be specified A possible solution keeping this general page with only the most important inventions for each period with links to the more detailed sub articles This way none of the original links has to be changed while creating a good overview page for anyone interested in a rough but digestable overview on inventions throughout history,0

Craig s background is key to EFT and a similar brief description is mentioned by very many sources although nobody seems to know how Craig made the step from engineering student to creator of a new medical paradigm I m happy to omit the realtor thing since it s much less widely discussed than the ordained minister notion We won t achieve neutrality in alt med articles by removing any sourced content which even tangentially casts doubt on the subject I ve added a few extra sources on this point To avoid focussing too much on Craig I have also provided some more detail on the process to soothe concerns about neutrality or bias I got the latter from a source which takes EFT seriously rather than from an EBM source If you have any more detail on how EFT is actually supposed to work feel free to add it,0
This clearly states that he has signed for United but will be staying at Partizan until January 2010 a loan Also see here under 2 January it says he has signed for United and returned on as season long loan to Partizan There are many other websites that cooperate with this in a similar fashion Why must Wikipedia be the only website displaying incorrect information,0
That is not an argument I could say that I have met Doc Shiels and he said that his pictures of the Loch Ness Monster are true He sticks to his story that what he saw that day was a flesh and blood lake creature Have YOU ever met Doc Shiels I have been involved in the Loch Ness Monster phenomenon for 16 years I believe I know what I m talking about SEE HOW STUPID THAT SOUNDS Bob Gimlim has been making off this video just because you met him has nothing to do with the validity of the film Bob has said many things over the years including that he admitted that he could have been fooled too He also won t deny Bob Heironimus s confession of being the guy in the suit Not consistent now is he The bigfoot in the film is fake get over it By the way I have met Bob Heironimus and he maintains that he wore the suit Have YOU met Bob Heironimus I have been debunking bigfoot claims for over 20 years I believe I know what I m talking about How is that for a bit of your own twisted logic,1
The U hand gesture has nothing to do with the name The U It has to do with the split U logo which is called The U The school is called The U The sports community refers to it as The U Even forgetting the single hit on the school s website for The U S State Dept the use of The U even in quotations of faculty staff or on the website itself shows the pervasiveness of the name The U may be an abbreviation for The University but that does not in any way mean that every school known as The University of is The U Only a few are referred to as such The U is an informal name just like any alias for any major university Researchers from wiki link do not introduce themselves as being from NC State as far as I am aware If you want to be really anal about the use of the words then when the article is unprotected because of your repeated edit warring over the lead paragraph commonly can be replaced with informally And the only reason all of this is too complicated to shoehorn into the first sentence is because you are making it overly complicated,0

Copy and pasting an article from elsewhere adding a little window dressing and posting it as a new entry is something most elementary school students know is bad form and plagiarism whether the copyright is active or has run out I can understand c p ing it into a sandbox as a way to have source material handy is understandable but not making it into an article itself You are not implying by any chance that articles written by homosexuals are any less credible than articles written by heterosexuals are you No thank you for the implication I m a homophobe I can truthfully state that I m not one Now that that s out of the way here s my take on the Knitting Circle article on Lawrence which is longer than the bland IMDB like bios on the site I have trouble taking the KC article seriously merely on the basis of content and tone It contains speculation presented as fact For instance The sons were regularly beaten by Sarah Lawrence especially Ned a unelaborated line that is speculation presented as fact In the Wikipedia article you also repeated the KC article s author s manner of presenting speculation as fact Lawrence fell in love with the youth is an echo of KC s He also fell in love with the 15 year old Arab peasant boy Salim Ahmed whom he called Dahoum speculation presented as fact in both instances though with far more context than the solo abusive parent sentence hanging in space Here s another from the WP entry Despite Lawrence s occasional suggestions that S A is a composite character modern scholars consider the initials to be Dahoum s I doubt that 100 of modern Lawrence scholars have come to a unanimous decision,0

First of all do not use a newsletter such as CounterPunch as a source This is already the second time that you introduce unacceptable sources into this article Please make yourself familiar with WP RS if you have not yet done so Responses of Muslim leaders and European journalists are ok in principle if they are presented according to their notability The sentence does not do that in fact it is highly misleading A single Muslim leader is many Muslim leaders and the single Muslim leader also said But it s not against Jews it s against Israel what is in clear contrast with the fact that most attacks were on French Jews and not Israelis and Israeli installations If you want to have a reaction of Muslim leaders there is already a section on their reactions and they condemn these attacks,0

Actually you re flogging a dead horse by posting this to the RSN The issue of various Russian sources see here for Russia today where ITAR TASS and other sources have also been discussed has been done to death If anyone even bothers to pick up on it after months of deliberation I ll be surprised The rule of thumb has been determined that per WP BIASED both Russian and Ukrainian sources are fine for direct statements from officials but only usable where deemed appropriate by consensus with WP INTEXT attribution and or where supported by other reliable sources No sources are taken for granted as being absolutely reliable and these articles are WP NOTNEWS Utmost care has been taken to remain neutral at the height of POV traffic pushing one side or the other As for your offer to translate Russian sources at the RSN there are plenty of editors working on these articles who ve been doing so for months along with German articles Polish articles etc,0

That said a possible solution would be a an enWP article about Nachhaltigkeit as a German Term The land of Guttenberg is sort of more exact with the meaning of a term still and it should be part of articles and b a clear definition of the sustainability article and a reduction of the article along that line If as claims the article is not about the eco moevement and not about ecology per se the current content is completely out of line Suggest a definition and say which section titles fall under it The rest is to be deleted,0
I think it is OK to give a short description of the arguments that does seem to be a reasonable way of describing what the hypothesis is about which is one of the aims of the article But it should be presented in a way so that it is perfectly clear what the mainstream view is on each point And it should not contain any synthesis of the kind that is currently there It doesn t matter if the arguments are wrong lots of interesting theories of the past we wouldn t be able to write about then what matters is that it is clear to the reader what the mainstream view point is The problem with the hypothesis by the way is mainly that it is not supported by the fossil evidence and that it is a single cause hypothesis of a kind which is simply unable to explain the complex patterns we now know characterizes human evolution,0

The writer of the article it must be disclosed provides a Sino centric view of Korea s origins It is undisputed that Korea in its myriad of ethno political forms borrowed considerably from China both culturally and politically But to somehow assert that Korea may have somehow originated with the migration and settlement of a Chinese family on the Peninsula is not only unsubstantiated it should be viewed as a deliberate attempt to undermine Korea s own history as well as the abundance of anthropological evidence which documents the presence of an indigenous peoples on the Peninsula long before the existence of a formal Chinese state One need only look at the revisionist sinocentric histories of Tibet and Formosa Taiwan that were promulgated by China to evidence its ancient claims to the lands China is and always has been a hegemony that has grown in size over many centuries This growth has been patient and steady But it has relied on a long series of small falsehoods and on occasion outright aggression Tibet is the clearest demonstration of this Military troops invaded murdered and pillaged The historical documents were destroyed And China engaged in a policy of seizing Tibetan land and redistributing it to resettled Han Chinese China it is suspected is supporting the Maoist rebels in neighboring Nepal these well funded terrorists have succeeded in murdering the royal family and creating political and economic chaos Maybe in time it too will be overtaken by China Not surprisingly border disputes have been common China and Mongolia China and Vietnam China and India they actually fought in a short lived war China and Japan China and Russia China and the Philippines Spratley Islands etc And now China is at it again attempting to revise Korean history and its geography with the recent controversial decision official state policy to downplay and discount the Korean origin of the Kogoryo Kingdom one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea which claimed territory on the northern parts of the Peninsula as well as parts of what was then Manchuria Any astute observer of Chinese history will see this move for what it is another small lie in a long chain of lies that will lead possibly to historical claims to Korea,0

There is now no unifying theory or application Whereas before the term formerly referred to former Democrats turned Republican now it does not Whereas the term formerly dealt with domestic issues now it sometimes does When paleoconservatives use the term it refers to domestic issues along with foreign policy issues but when Democrats use the term it soley refers to foreign policy Now the term is solely about politics and not any underlying theory The only commonalities from the old definition to the new definition are that the term primarily refers to Republicans A term that had a use in the days of the Soviet Union and the Cold War may have little usage today That does not mean that it is proper to resurrect the term if now it means something entirely different And if the term is resurrected in any event then we must acknowledge if the meaning has changed or is otherwise meaningless,0

By the way if we used Ian s review article by Narlikar as a standard we would have to totally exclude and rewrite most of the article as the non standard cosmologies of 1980 are very different from the non standard cosmologies of today In 1980 Linde hadn t developed inflation the error bars on the Hubble Constant were on the order of 10s of km s Mpc the CMB hadn t been precisely measured There was no such thing as plasma cosmology as out article on the subject outlines it the quasar controversies were not resolved and there were still steady staters hanging around hoping for integrated starlight to work Using out of date reviews doesn t serve as a decent standard for inclusion Narlikar could not get such a review published today as the controversy is over as far as the community is concerned,0
I have to say that Shorne doesn t seem to allow any compromise He just presents his extremist views and puts them in articles He discards all opinions other than his own and all data not supporting his views even the generally known and obvious facts as lies and propaganda and remove them from articles without any discussion or adding comments Then he reverts changes made by other Wikipedians His strategy is to make a reversion and then try to engage opponents in endless and ineffective discussions so as to let his version stay It is enough to look at the articles he edited I guess he was involved in an edit war in each of them I hope I am wrong but I m afraid the problem will persist until Shorne is banned because I can t see any respect for other points of views and NPOV on his side,0

I m sorry that you find my comments rude but the simple fact is that you proposed replacing a third world country with a mountain You spat in our faces If you thought that the mountain was somehow the more common usage in English you could have said so maybe backed it up with some evidence not proposed a page move If you want to ask people what they think you ask them what they think but instead you went straight to a poll which makes consensus impossible I did not intend to imply that you were intentionally insulting the insult was in the unthinking dismissal of us Maybe chauvinism was the wrong word Maybe it was just unconscious bias against the third world or against the Caribbean I was wrong to propose motivation But it s still an insult but what s far more disturbing is that you obviously don t have a clue why it was insulting,0

The NIH source National Institute of Health uses the term treatment Competing ideas and criticism are found at other wikipedia articles I ve noticed a persistent effort among many users to try to spread their activism wherever they can in wikipedia their own articles are not enough so sort of like writing to politicians in masses they persistently edit wikipedia articles to infiltrate their POV which is contrary to Wikipedia rules I ve been wondering if this is due to how many especially many with autism and Aspergers spend immense time on the Internet many many times more time than most others I wonder if their activity on the Internet is based on their deficits in doing other outside Internet activities such as socializing exercising working travel culture,0

Matisse thank you for making the edits you have done Could we perhaps discuss them somewhat before investing too much more effort for now I think SEWilco should be allowed to comment and I have some comments I question some changes For example The article has been revised to show The cream colored brick building is neoclassical in style with the base spandrels friezes cornices and the parapet finished in white stucco The entrance is divided into seven bays by engaged columns with a pavillion on each end 3 That rephrases from Harrison direct quote Exterior walls are cream colored brick with white stucco finishes at the base spandrels friezes cornices and parapet Engaged columns divide the entrance into seven bays flanked by pavilions at the north and south ends I am not sure how helpful is the paraphrasing here For one thing it is not a summary as it is as long as the quote Also if it is left as a quote then it is clear that it was Harrison s judgment that the building is cream colored We don t know if the building is still cream colored or not I believe that is Harrison s judgement more than 20 years ago Also i don t know what an engaged column is If we aren t conversant ourselves with the terms used by an expert it is probably not helpful to rearrange them as we will introduce errors This problem was discussed in the wikipedia discussions which I still cannot find yet about why it is not good to mix in primary source material Does anyone know what an engaged column is And do you see what I mean about revising expert primary material,0

While I understand your perspective that she is no longer running in her own right has zero impact on either the LEGAL existence or ONGOING legitimacy of her candidacy In itself that ongoing by LAW candidacy is an integral and absorbing if not THE absorbing aspect of this election She is on and will remain on the ballot twice in fact There is a high liklihood that she will garner votes and appears intent on actively supporting opposing the candidacy of others I simply cannot imagine any legitimate justification for ignoring those realities by simply erasing her name from the article s election box I urge any interested parties to comment,0
I don t think you are right about this article being biased against mysticism Other readers who have a more scientific materialistic point of view have objected that this article is too charitable to the mystical point of view The point of separating physics from philosophy is to separate min the physics literature from the philosophy literature The philosophy literature was often written by people who didn t have a clue about quantum mechanics and is often embarassing to read,0
The policy apparently contradicts itself extensively in its first paragraph I was highlighting the fact that this is not an appropriate venue for arguments and discussion at all I find it appropriate to colour words like that with red In later paragraphs the policy goes into specific exceptions Perhaps you would like to write one in You mentioned the election Okay so it s safe to assume that someone will win and Bush won t install a military Junta That s about all you can say about it today,0

Those links you shared are the first sources beyond Wikipedia where I have seen this claim about the statue possibly representing Surena However the veracity of their claims would be much stronger if they came from edu i e college and university websites or an official website of an established art and history museum What I do know is that after reading academic sources on the matter including Brosius 2006 and Curtis 2007 nowhere is it mentioned that this statue was made to resemble Surena If this was a commonly accepted idea in modern academia then I would surely have come across it instead the sources I have read refer to the statue as resembling a nameless man an anonymous nobleman who wears the distinctive Parthian riding outfit That is all And Udimu makes an excellent point about this statue perhaps representing a local ruler or nobleman of Elymais where it was found,0

No the above articles you mention already include some information about the subject of this article for what I hope are obvious reasons The topic however is not the same The Republic of China occupying the mainland from 1912 1949 is in some important ways a distinct topic from the topic discussed at Taiwan the ROC we know today That the ROC Is now commonly known as Taiwan should give you a clue that the topics while closely related are not one and the same,0
The only thing being ignored is the policy on civility comment on content not contributors Beyond that you replied to something that I didn t write I said that any occurrence of an attack that RS say targets civilians should be included and I included examples of such attacks carried out by Israelis What I also said was that this discussion should focus on the 1 2 cases actually responsible for this dispute,0

You could always have it as a direction page to one giving the link to a separate page for each maybe giving each a bracketed section such as Maiden Lane GNR railway station and Maiden Lane North London railway station I m not entirely sure as to how that s exactly done but I m sure some of the other users on here would help with that If that idea doesn t float your boat you could include them both on the same page with separate sections for each station I d imagine neither of them would be incredibly long so maybe this method would be more suitable,0
And yes the lede says whose absence enhances their effect on the plot because the source says advance the plot but their physical presence is unnecessary In fact their absence may make them appear more powerful Again you re ridiculously splitting hairs here you re engaging in tendentious editing And yes I did paraphrase because we are SUPPOSED TO PARAPHASE Long quotations crowd the actual article and remove attention from other information Many direct quotations can be minimized in length by providing an appropriate context in the surrounding text A summary or paraphrase of a quotation is often better where the original wording could be improved Putting quotations in ledes is especially sloppy,0
So you agree with me at least on one point your sources only reflect Litvish opinion so you have no basis to say that there is general Hareidi opposition to Rabbi Steisalz And you did not respond to my comments that Rabbi Fischer of Eda Hareidi declared that the issue was resolved And you did not respond to what everyone knows is that this comes within the context of Chabad Litvish tensions which have no place within an encyclopedia article If this comment goes in here then we should add to the wiki article wiki link Rav Shach s comments that the Lubavitcher Rebbe was a heretic or other comments that Yated has published about Chabad By the way why should these comments be here and not mentioned anywhere in the wiki link article itself None of this belongs in an encyclopedia This is pure reputation smearing even and especially if the Yated prints it,0
Outside view To be a pseudoscience something has to be presented as scientific when it isn t Was this stuff ever presented as scientific or was it a sort of new age philosphical effort The article itself doesn t present it as scientific It just baldly describes it A little more on the extent to which it is not in accordance with current scentific understanding of brain organisation and evolution etc would be an improvement as would any particular criticism which is properly sourced,0

Is there currently an ongoing discussion about the edit war on this talk page to close the move discussion The talk looked productive with new editors involed and new evidences presented I am no expert when it comes to matters of this nature but it seems to me the close was done by someone who has been involed in the past with a certain POV on the matter I am sure it was all done with the best intentions but there was no consensus last time so as far as I understand it we are encouraged to proceed and find a consensus by way of introducing new facts and getting more editors involed,0

I was under the impression from Radosh and Milton s The Rosenberg File I think that the point of trying to give Ethel the death penalty was to induce a guilty plea in Julius that is if Julius pleaded then they would spare Ethel s life I believe he cites memos from Saypol to this effect In any event I am pretty sure there is hard evidence that the death penalties were seen as both sending powerful messages and hopefully getting them to talk though I believe J Edgar Hoover famously and accurately predicted that the double execution would have a psychological effect on the populace which would cause a lot of them to doubt the entire endeavor Anyway I ll try to source these when I get a chance in general I think the Radosh book is the best thing I ve read on the trial most thorough and balanced anyhow,0

Roundtrip speed is c and one way speed after Einstein synchronisation is c And both this statements are equivalent This was known and published in the times of Einstein and Reichenbach and is still valid and re iterated today In modern coordinate free formulation the issue of Einstein synchronisation vs consistent alternatives doesn t even arise it s clear that it s only about the choice of coordinates Do you suggest that we re word to the more correct but obscure sounding One of the most highly counterintuitive of these results and as stated above commonly included in statements of the second postulate is that inertal observes can choose their coordinate systems so that the speed of light in vacuum commonly denoted c is the same to all of them,0

Hi Slytime By mentioning that I don t care if it is an adaptation or a remake I meant that nobody knows Sanjay Gupta claimed that his film wasn t a remake but a homage apparantly Old Boy s copyright holders didn t think so and he got sued Nikhil Advani may claim that his movie isn t a remake either but since no one has seen the movie Advani can say almost everything about his movie since people can t proof otherwise Once the movie is out I very much care if it is an adaptation or a remake but currently most statements are mere speculation IMHO I agree that Gupta and Advani are both indivuals but both of them are directors and in order to stay neutral they should both be treated the same As for the pictures choose the one which you deem fitting I think Khan looks very much the same on them but on the SEI pic he kinda grimaces and it has a bad resolution Maybe a better SEI pic can be added when wallpapers are out on the net Otherwise I think there are few pictures which show him sporting his short hair look or even his bald head and there are no clear pictures of him acting in Baabul or Jaane E Man so in order to replace the Lucky pic I suggest we have to wait for the press kit to be released Best regards,0

It s late and I m tired but here are three refs showing the academic tolerance of non standard cosmology researchers Please note that in the UK both Sheffield and Cardiff Uni astronomy departments are well respected I could find more but anyone seaching the internet will quickly find two things 1 non standard or alternative cosmology is a recognised term within the astrophysic astronomy community and 2 that the only people who consider creationists cosmologies as non standard in the scientifically recognised sense are the creationists themselves I don t know what else to say to convince SA I m not spinning anything just trying to share my experience of the field I was at the Royal Astronomical Society meeting when Fred Hoyle presented his paper on panspermia He was given a very rough ride as you can imagine but the debate was a scientific one The RAS would never invite a creation scientist to deliver a lecture for the simple fact that as they call to supernatural solutions their work fails to be science To qualify as science it must be falsifiable omnipotent omnipresent omniscient beings cannot be proven false However they dress up the created light etc god did the deed and therefore it is not science SA s constant ignoring of this falsifiability issue baffles me as the significance should be well appreciated by any competent scientist Even the wackiest science based non standard cosmology can be falsified The problem I am having is finding a reference that states explicitly that the scientific community only considers science based non standard cosmologies as this is so obvious to anyone in the field they don t bother to say so All I can find is academic cosmology review papers that don t include creationism not what SA has called for For SA to say we will not work with him is saddening as I see the reverse situation For him to accuse me of OR is a fair point all I know is I bring 25 years of direct experience of the astronomy physics community here and I say this article is wrong to include creationist cosmologies I have talked to other currently active astrophysicists who agree with me The only fault in all my observations is that they are heavily UK Europe biased due to my experience However I have not seen any US academic cosmological reviews that include creationism along with the non standard cosmologies they do discuss From the moving goal posts the irrelevant links provided by SA to support his view and his attempts to move this onto more personal ground I can see this is a waste of time I suspect there is some history between the other players on this page that is imeding progress here and so admit defeat If I thought more refs would help I would bother but I just know the three I have given above will somehow be found wanting so further time spent here is pointless I hoped editing the physics articles would not carry the same baggage as the religious ones I previously spent a lot of time with but I was wrong,0

I have a concern with the recent good faith additions to the Lead While I think the Lead should have a mention of other Latter Day Saint denominations most notably the Community of Christ and Mormon Fundamentalism I don t think it should have in depth discussions of their theology particularly since the CoC isn t considered part of Mormonism and has rejected the title Mormon Before the recent additions the Lead had a single link to the CoC in the 3rd paragraph It now links in the 1st and 3rd paragraphs with both paragraphs mentioning that the CoC s theology is Trinitarian While I think such information is both interesting accurate and useful I don t think it belongs in the Lead of Mormonism epsecially since the Lead is supposed to summarize the article and this information is not contained in the article body As a solution I propose either moving the recent additions to a footnote somewhere or perhaps to a new subsection under Theological foundations near the Relation to Christianity subsection It might have a title like Relation to other Latter Day Saint denominations or something like that It could also be worked in as a paragraph under Relation to Christianity or Theological divisions Thoughts,0
Well this is what I have to say as my last hoorah Kinsella left 2 years before the sponsership scandal started There is an obvious bias in the current version Kinsella s father recieved the order of Canada I think some mention of that should be allowed requesting CSD for entries relating to Warren Kinsella must be stopped The lawsuit against bloggers Should not say that he aroused controversy he is after all the Prince of Darkness Too much time is spent on MArk Bourrie in the entry Saying that Kinsella did the Barney stunt based on the idea of somone else is like saying that G W Bush said the Axis of Evil because the speechwriter David Frum thought of it Unneccesary detail Too much detail Excluding the fact that he is a best selling author should stop,0

I don t believe that the article is at odds with any of the things you state Sealand is mainly interesting as an idea because it serves as a sort of bookend or milepost for the micronation concept The article makes it as clear as possible that its status is self proclaimed We at Wikipedia are not qualified to decide whether it is part of the UK a soverign state neither or both Nor is there any need for us to do so Roughs Tower is there the Sealand story is a cool one we present the facts and let the reader decide,0
Thank you Kim Yes US was probably singled out for the same reason If it is necessary to single out China on this issue in wikipedia the right way to do it is NOT saying it is top emitter without saying the per capita emission is 1 4 of that of US which as we all know is misleading China does lag on energy efficiency And if any people objected what I edited in this page I don t mind them singling out China for emissions per GDP Also there has been no contest for including a small diagram about the per capita data in the page for quite a while I cannot agree with Jklamo about removing for the reason of irrelevance the statement about comparison about China and US s per capita data I personally feel that per capita and per GDP measures about emissions should all be merged into this article to give accurate and complete picture and the issues Especially merging the 3 articles mostly will lead to a table with a few more columns that will not become messy to fit in one page I can see only positive effect by merging them well in terms of truth and complete truth not in terms of views of people with certain political biases and or intention,0

Stephen Colbert is not doing anything wrong by talking about wikipedia on his very funny show He is exploiting the problems that wikipedia faces including vandalism and nonsense Microsoft paying people to write a more positive entry is something that wikipedia must combat Stephen Colbert and his show is mocking wikipedia and I think that this community needs to come to terms with that He may not intend to do so but he is actually improving wikipedia Everything he is saying is true Businesses if wikipedia is not careful are going to write their own entries and POV will go down the drain So while elephants may or may not be increasing because of Stephen it sure is making wikipedia users more aware of the issues that this encyclopedia faces Reality is a commodity Oh and we must be aware of bears I mean businesses because if we are not careful wikipedia is just going to be one big ad,0
I never wrote about Southern Dutch but merely mentioned the Dutch term Zuid Nederlands which translates to Southern Dutch Here s a group in a whatever Univerity of Ghent Department Dutch Linguistics And there might be a few others I m not too fond of the Zuid Nederlands myself because it has three different meanings of which two are of a linguistic nature one as I had stated the second as only of the current region of Flanders just like one of our meanings of Flemish the third and most common means about any subject from the current region of Flanders that dates from the time the Low Countries were still united thus only adding to the confusion Though about the first one for which there is no other word that I can think of just the rather common description Nederlands beneden de grote rivieren Dutch below south of the large rivers without even shortly mentioning it as I had done Wikipedia is a little less complete which means contributing to the illusion of a not so confused understanding 2006 06 26 15 19 UTC,0

With respect to my good friend Tony who asserts that evidence of wide currency is absent I disagree The subject of this article is in wide circulation within the third party media sources and we will certainly be adding additional sources over time to continue to flesh out the list of events claimed as evidence of the phenomenon Regarding his assertion that the topic is being treated as a scientific hypothesis he might wish to consult his dictionary to refresh his memory on the definition of the word mythical Regarding his comment that the following sentence makes the piece look like a parody of a Wikipedia article that is the most that can be stated based on the sources analyzed thus far As I noted on Mark s talk page we should seek to improve this aspect of the article assuming that it even continues in its current direction And finally regarding his statement that The sentence that follows is almost as bad the sentence in question is completely appropriate given the feedback this article has received thus far including his comment above that this article was being treated as a scientific hypothesis The inclusion of this sentence is important to make it clear to the reader that this is NOT a serious scientific theory but is instead a topic of political humor within pop culture,0

Exactly Whilst the article still pipes Levine s question to our wiki article Who is a Jew on modern Jewish identity the spectrum of what it means to be Jewish today is very different to what the spectrum of what it meant to be Jewish Ioudaioi 2 000 years ago This is explained in detail in the sources above,0
Yeah good points Actually I ve always though that there is indeed a historical similarity between the Neo Assyrian Empire and Nazi Germany as far as the Jewish populations are concerned Ten Lost Tribes Holocaust But that s probably it It seems those who advocate this theory have continued finding traces and patterns of similarities between two different empires based on the connection with the Jews Who knows maybe they re on to something But the name needs a change IMHO We ll stick with this one for now and perhaps we ll come up with something better once the article is developed a bit more By the way dab great work on the article Not everyday I tell you this,0

Well there are a lot of Athabasca projects in the pipeline so production may rapidly increase if all goes well One of the bugaboos bottlenecks often cited is the price supply of natural gas to heat the tar An obvious alternative is to build one or more nuclear power plants as a source for steam and hot water This approach would substantially decrease the greenhouse gas emissions of the tar sands plants as well Whether this would be politically acceptable in Alberta I couldn t say Not likely to be coming soon Cheers,0

Reposting this with minor changes from the dispute resolution noticeboard where Robert McClenon has decided to close the discussion After ZH8000 s request to have this talk page protected so that my disruption of serious reasoning with unsane sic nonsense can be stopped and the fact that the current state of the page is in his her favor it was probably too much to expect him her to be willing to discuss at the dispute resolution noticeboard Nevertheless I m glad that other people are willing to see eye to eye and contribute new sources So how about this for the change talkquote As Switzerland only offers a CHF 40 35 75 yearly option their vignette is the highest priced one in Europe for transiting and visiting passenger car drivers other countries offer vignettes valid for shorter periods which cost less than the Swiss version,0

As most of these articles seem to do they focus too heavily on the notion that white supremacy is based more on racial bigotry than it is on either cultural elitism of just logical observations on the superior development of some cultures over others For example Is the culture of Switzerland superior or inferior to the culture of Saudi Arabia One culture that accepts the coequal status of gender sexual orientation and for the most part race over one that does not Based on most of this article it makes it seem that if the Swiss believe their ways are superior to the Saudis then that would make them white supremacists Rather than just possibly that this particular white culture is superior to that particular non white culture Preceding unsigned comment added by,0

Oppose WBX is not the proper name of the song Even if I would agree to moving this page it d be to W B X in the first bit I have no idea what nakaguro style hyphens are The W B X part is essentially an abbreviation of the second part of the song title for which they use dashes instead of periods I saw at Talk Move Japanese band Requested move that the name M o v e would be fine if that band was called Em Oh Vee Ee Well this song is called Double Bee Ex and not Wibbix so W B X should be fine per whatever manuals of style there are I have repeatedly argued that this page is at a good title because aside from the tildes You are not moving this page from the title that it clearly states on the album art and on all print media on this release And I made a thread on WT MOS JA months ago that no one ever bothered to respond to about this The title of this page is not changing because my arguments for the page at this current title seemed to be fine last time So a definite no to WBX W Boiled Extreme I may concede if it was W B X W Boiled Extreme but an administrator will need to deal with that The name of this song is parsed entirely in English If the dashes and tildes are such an issue I will have to argue that the MOS be modified so they can be accepted It is entirely bullshit to rename things to the way we want instead of using the original names,0

Another editor changed the boundaries as given by The New York Times when boundaries given without explanation or byline by Google Maps Google Maps has enough errors in it as anyone who has used it knows that any claim it makes to the unofficial traditionally derived boundaries of a New York City neighborhood cannot be taken as gospel specifically when it contradicts a highly reliable source like the Times which write about City neighborhoods constantly Nevertheless in the spirit of compromise I have left both claims of boundaries in since choosing one of the other is POV,0
How could Wikipedia face these challenges Scrap the current monolithic article model and begin publishing incremental edits in wiki link instead Make a wiki link I realize this term is already used in wiki link which sounds more like wiki link content edited in a traditional wiki This way independent third parties could serve customized edit filters into the main Wikipedia database For instance one site could serve only articles composed of edits made by scholars together with minor edits by non scholars perhaps to allow for things like spelling corrections Another site could serve only articles composed of edits approved by a board of editors whose particular editorial style you like Yet another site could serve edits based on mass moderation And yet another site say wikipedia org could allow you to select from all the available edits to an article in order to tailor the article which meets your exact quality demands Companies like Google could mirror the edit database and apply their own proprietary search and ranking technologies Contributors could discuss and evaluate single edits in detail and so on Wikis has opened up editing Now let s open up viewing as well,0

How about we use Assyrian mythology as the title of the page and we make a note in the article that it is also referred to as Ashurism I don t see a point in arguing over the name of the article it s not a huge deal Gareth you re right in that it isn t used in academia but I disagree with your comment that it has no value If the term Buddhism has any value then the term Ashurism definitely has value simply by default regardless of academic use or the lack thereof Who knows maybe the term Ashurism can gain momentum in this century and become an academic term,0
Hello I came across this page and can t help but notice most of the page consists of criticism of Amen s practice Criticism is great but if not balanced by alternative perspectives easily runs afoul of WP Balance WP BLP and WP Neutral point of view I assume the argument to my reverter is that the page is fair and balanced because most academics seem to criticize his practices although to point at the blatantly obvious if he is the most popular psychiatrist in America clearly there are noteworthy voices supporting his practices Just glancing through the big Washington Post article I can see that there are several quotes supporting Amen that have been left out in what looks to be a glaring case of WP Cherrypicking POVs Wikipedia Biographies of living persons Balance mandates at least mentioning those viewpoints or risk a BLP violation I won t go so far as to say this page is a WP Coatrack for anti SPECT alternative medicine viewpoints but it is definitely veering that direction I am leaving the tag up at least until I have the proper time to check for opposing views or until consensus is met here that the problem is fixed Thanks Looks like a lot of activity on this page so I m happy to see I likely won t be working alone Note the balance tag can also be removed if one of these criteria is met Template Unbalanced When to remove,0

The Talk page of the project is not where the rules are you can t quote that as your basis for removing this Anyway this is a totally different thing to the deletion of articles dedicated to broadcasters it is simply about having it as a section within an article for which there is no consensus for removal only one user who believes they should be kept and made into tables like this one is and you who is going round doing it without consensus I would agree that it doesn t deserve its own article but there is no problem with it having a section within this article,0

Your recent editing history at wiki link shows that you are currently engaged in an wiki link To resolve the content dispute please do not revert or change the edits of others when you get reverted Instead of reverting please use the article s wiki link to work toward making a version that represents wiki link among editors The best practice at this stage is to discuss not edit war See wiki link for how this is done If discussions reach an impasse you can then post a request for help at a relevant wiki link or seek wiki link In some cases you may wish to request temporary wiki link Being involved in an edit war can result in your being wiki link especially if you violate the wiki link which states that an editor must not perform more than three wiki link on a single page within a 24 hour period Undoing another editor s work whether in whole or in part whether involving the same or different material each time counts as a revert Also keep in mind that while violating the three revert rule often leads to a block you can still be blocked for edit warring even if you don t violate the three revert rule should your behavior indicate that you intend to continue reverting repeatedly,0

I already explained the problem above Anarcho capitalists define intiation of force to include things like trepass of property or eating an apple shoplifted from a store Commonly or at the very least amongst a significant number of people initation of force is considered to apply only or generally to the physical person violence or restraint used against a body So for the article to say that they are against initiation of force when they in fact support using force to repel say non aggressive trespassers or at times even to forcefully claim restitution or enact punishment on a shoplifter is biased in favor of a conception of initiation of force that is specific to anarcho capitalists The only reason I m letting the claim stand is because it is now clearly labeled as a claim but your import of initiation of force as distinct from response throws that NPOV out the window and tells the reader that yes in fact the capitalists are always responding to force when they enact their little system of property domination,0

On September 30 I placed a citation request at the end of the opening sentence in which a definition of Quebec bashing is provided There has been considerable discussion as to what exactly is meant by Quebec bashing both on this page and as part of the AfD nomination As stated in numerous discussions it would seem that there is no definition of the term provided outside of this article meaning that the definition is the creation of Wikipedians In my opininion the creation of a definition and subsequent attempts at reaching a consensus which does not appear to be forthcoming around which an article might be built amounts to original research My citation request has twice been removed and replaced with a reference in which two individuals claim that Quebec has been criticized unfairly in the English language media including that of the United States As previously stated see 20 15 30 September 2006 this reference fails to address the expressed purpose of the citation request That Quebec or any other political entity has on occasion been criticized unfairly in international media has not been in dispute Therefore I question the re appearance of a citation that in no way provides a definition of the term Assuming good faith I will leave it in place and will return my citation request,0

Your second edit removed a statement that song were performed by a character This is still true regardless of the quality of the lip synch which is why I reverted it Essentially your claim is that bad lip synching is not lip synching and therefore must be something else That is clearly OR and recentism for that matter Considering that the film was at the cutting edge of synchronizing pre recorded sound with live filmed by a camera performance it would be a miracle if some people didn t do it badly In any case the claim that bad lip synching means something else clearly needs a source so you should hardly be surprised to receive brusqueness when you continue to press an extremely obvious point The Jazz Singer being the film it is subject to volumes of writing and analysis it s inconceivable that your point wouldn t be supportable by a citation from a reliable source were it actually the case so go find it or drop the issue please,0
It was hardly surprising to find yesterday s textual additions peremptorily removed by this particular faction whose reputation goes before them My contribution did not involve deletion of existing material and is pertinent to the article These modest insertions could have been challenged in the usual way The sources as Haiduc suggested can be checked I think you have to ask yourselves the following Are you interested in the subject of this article Have you seriously researched this subject Are you qualified to research and contribute to this article Are you interested in applying standards of historical truth to the work undertaken by editors This is a scholarly field of enquiry The subject may be controversial in the minds of today s public at large but their opinion is not in any way relevant to this undertaking a specialist historical survey of an under researched topic The kind of editors who are most likely to have something valuable to contribute here will have in depth experience of scholarship Classics and can read sources in the original languages Others can sometimes offer helpful material provided they approach the subject as we all should with respect and humility and take time to read the source material available comprehensive though it may be Incidentally I have as you may have noticed drawn upon recent work by Prof W A Percy who can be contacted direct If you doubt the integrity or relevance of his expertise do just that I expect to revert the article to the abbreviated version of my insertions If you have anything to say I suggest you avoid another deletion and make your point on the talk page In the meantime I will consider further repairs to what has become a damaged presentation,0
quite to the contrary while the neutral NGO Human Rights Watch does not flatly state in its report that the USA is a police state its report remains deeply critical of ongoing human rights abuses in the USA Also please note that the article in its current revsion does not make the allegation that the USA is a police state it only mentions it it a separate section entitled United States Controversy This creates the impression that there is much disagreement over whether or not the USA is or should be considered a police state which is an accurate indication of public opinion and a reflection of the contraversy which is erupting among Wikipedia editors on this discussion board I see no such problem with the article in its current form Furthermore i Expect to see some more civility and respect for the facts on this discussion board it is especially dissapointing to see loaded words and inaccurate statements coming form administrartors This is clearly an abuse of administrator power,0

Thank you for your reply User I did indeed read Uspensky s article and in fact added a quote from him to the article As he is a historian I believe his view adds value to the article though I myself have never heard this view and believe it to be speculation On the other hand Chaudet s view is one that is far more prevalent also mentioned in the external link and external link just to name a couple sources If you noticed I also added a reference from another academic journal the Journal of South Asian and Middle Eastern Studies which also corroborates Chaudet s view the quote states Finally the Russians under Ivan the Terrible defeated the Tatars in 1552 and firmly established Russian rule In celebration of this conquest the czar built two churches in the Moscow Kremlin and on the spires of the Church installed the Orthodox Cross over an upside down crescent the symbol of Islam Since scholarly sources present this view as well to be neutral we must include both views appropriately attributing those views to the authors I hope this helps With regards,0
I understand that the capital of Gibraltar is Gibraltar but in the gibraltar article there is not much information on the urban area of gibraltar and o central article where people can go to get information on the settlement itself so why don t we have an article on the page It should in my view be a stub on the page with a link to a main article the settlement of Gibraltar which would explain the buildings and the history of the settlement from its operation as a small naval base for the moors its short spanish occupation and it under British administration Do you agree with me,0

By referring to the policy which as I ve already pointed out finds a directory of these organisations acceptable but not a list A case could perhaps be made for including yoshukai org and wykko com but most of the international organisations mentioned in the article are not notable in their own right and probably shouldn t even be included in the text of the article let alone as an external link,0
No they are not characters That was a short lived promise but not unexpected Folks who act like that rarely do keep their word The current heading is fully appropriate for the content and obviously none of the FA reviewers had any problem with it Unlike you they are knowledgeable on what makes a high quality Wikipedia article and it is their collective approval of this article that I will trust not stalkers who can t even keep a promise for 2 hours,0
Yes because the basic problem is the same adding categories based on personal interpretation which is a form of original research What got CensoredScribe banned was the scale of his edits his absolute refusal to listen and his persistence that he was ultimately right even when everyone else disagreed with him,0
It s because most of the people that lord over this page are very overt fans of his as you say and they simply chock up any criticism of the man whatsoever to either willful misinterpretation or at worst a deliberate conspiracy to marginalize him When most of his writings concern the actions of the elite whose intentions are to keep the focus of discussions narrow so as to not let self evident facts into the matter those who fawn most strenuously are going to be paranoid about critical discussion not on their own terms So the criticisms are not represented very fairly in anything but a format of they said few words but Chomsky long quotation even where it is a point of fact that Chomsky has been harhsly criticized regarding something such as Cambodia as being callous they will not allow those terms to enter the discussion simply because it can t possibly be a correct interpretation Meanwhile the vast majority of this article before I came simply took up his characterizations of economics and foreign policy as presumed truths I moved this to the bottom as is custom Also please sign your comments,0

SO WG if you have an authority for your claim why don t you make an edit thhat Molotov s claim is challenged by so and so who says that Stalin learned of his mission on 10 May It did not lead him to cancel non existant invasion plans Instead he gave permission to his generals on 12 May to strengthen the western borders and allowed the call up of another 500 000 reservists but he still remained terrified of antagonising Hitler He even refused to believe that Hitler knew of the reconnaissance flights over Soviet air space and on 24 May stopped all further defensive preparations Best Wishes Will314159,0
According to me Again you are missing my point This should not be according to me or according to you or according to other private Polish citizen This should be according to a legal treaty signed by two governments and blessed by USA UK and France Also Polish government never denounced the treaty even after Stalin was long time dead you can t blame Stalin anymore We should base the article on facts and we should not put our personal interpretation into the title of the article though sometimes there is a way to convey your point of view in the article by saying something like The historian X interprets it this way But think again why Polish and German governments never disputed these borders We know why so this is not a soccer game but much more serious matter let s respect their position and let s avoid confrontational rhetoric There are other Wikipedia articles about Polish borders apparently you guys are obsessed with borders and if we want to keep this one first of all the title should be revised to Territories of Poland incorporated into the Soviet Union which is more neutral Please don t remove the unbalanced tag since this discussion suppose to go for a few weeks,0
I have read WP BLP which says the following All quotations and any material challenged or likely to be challenged must be explicitly attributed to a reliable published source which is usually done with an inline citation Contentious material about living persons or in some cases recently deceased that is unsourced or poorly sourced whether the material is negative positive neutral or just questionable should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion The material I have added is supported by three reliable sources two newspaper reports and one reddit post which provides the actual evidence of plagiarism Why then did you revert it without discussing,0

The number of green words so far counts up to 192 and many sites such as abstract indexes make a practice of quoting 300 So technically we don t have a literal copyright violation here The problem is that these quotes when not attributed count as WP Plagiarism We could legitimately quote that much with and appropriate referencing which of course is not true of an actual copyright violation i e longer length Nonetheless it s pretty clear that Wikipedia wants to stay far from plagiarism A reason often given with which I personally disagree is to uphold its reputation I don t think that amateur sometimes non academic writers actually need to uphold such a high reputation however Wikipedia has a different reason of its own which is that the content needs to be freely editable and reusable and there is a risk that if you take an article with 200 unattributed words and add a nice big quote or picture of your own you start getting into the area where there could be a genuine copyright violation and there s no way to know that without suppressing the plagiarism The point of this tldr pedantry of mine is just to point out that we won t need to suppress edit history or do other copyvio type responses here and those at fault should be pointed at the plagiarism policy rather than the copyright,0

This is why I wonder if the article on Ghost Hunters should carry the Pseudoscience tag and I am soliciting comments Some of the reasons for my query According to the Pseudoscience article the definition is any body of knowledge methodology or practice that is erroneously regarded as scientific Ghost Hunters seek to study ghosts by means of technology measurement and investigation They make claims and conclusions based on knowledge methodology and practices that are not subscribed to by the mainstream scientific community For this reason I think the TV show s premise is pseudoscience and promotes what I believe is a pseudoscientific POV Recently Robert L Park has listed The Seven Warning Signs of Bogus Science Many of these apply to ghost hunting in general and Ghost Hunters in particular 1 The discoverer pitches the claim directly to the media 2 The discoverer says that a powerful establishment is trying to suppress his or her work 3 The scientific effect involved is always at the very limit of detection 4 Evidence for a discovery is anecdotal 5 The discoverer says a belief is credible because it has endured for centuries 6 The discoverer has worked in isolation 7 The discoverer must propose new laws of nature to explain an observation Please Support or Oppose together with a comment and sign and date by either adding four tildes if you have an account or your name and date if you don t Thanks,0

I was surprised to find a source defining the proper time along a lightlike worldline as zero In my experience everyone leaves proper time along a lightlike worldline as an undefined concept it makes things easier because you don t need to make exceptions for light As well as the avoiding the potential confusion noted above by Cougar2013 it s also then compatible with the operational definition that proper time is what clocks measure Of course clocks can t travel at the speed of light For example Woodhouse Special Relativity p 104 uses this operational definition and Rindler Relativity Special General and Cosmological gives both operational p 65 and mathematical p 98 definitions both of which apply only to massive particles,0

Causteau I see you did yet another mass revert although you have no response to the above Let me put it more clearly mostly for the sake of others because you already know the following The source for preferring E1b1b1 as the preferred name for the clade defined by M35 in the Wikipedia article is the introduction of the article itself which cites Karafet and ISOGG The source for E3b1 in Henn 2008 being this same clade is Henn 2008 which is cited For sources where this is also called E M35 just look through the references and the article as it stood but especially see Cruciani and Karafet both of which are in the references and clearly cited as sources For sources where the 6th f sub clade name under E M35 is reserved for SNP P72 see Karafet which is already cited and now explained in detail in what you reverted away from In addition what you now wanted to remove was a new comment I added which even now explained the potential confusion and the exact name used in the Henn article and how it should be compared to the other references If you do not address this very tight chain of referencing and you insist on reverting as if you have then expect to be re reverted every time,0

That term gets thrown around Wikipedia a lot and frequently in places where it doesn t belong I see there was already a discussion about it What it really comes down to however is not what Wikipedia editors believe rather what the sources cited state Now the source given for that it s a PV is Welman which leads to dead links So we need a source that states that it s a PV Other online encyclopedias that I ve checked and aren t mirrors of this for example Britannia and Encarta I remember looking at just say that it was a victory or that he simply defeated Porus That doesn t sound Pyrrhic to me Secondly the casualty numbers I just got a copy of Fuller s Generalship the same one listed as a sources here and in it he briefly discusses the various casualty figures listed by the ancient writers He concludes that Diodorus figures are likely the most realistic that Porus lost 12 000 dead and 9 000 captured including 80 elephants and Alex lost 280 cavalry and 700 infantry no MIA captured numbers Now I see the numbers listed here come from several sources including Arrian and Diodorus both of which are discussed by Fuller and there s an obvious disparity but no apparent reason for why one figure was chosen over another I don t have a copy of Green s writing so I can t comment on that but I d be interested to hear why his numbers were chosen over Fuller s Same for the Arrian Curtius and Diodorus numbers So any thoughts,0

nine states prohibit same sex marriage in statute and 30 prohibit it in their constitutions This statement has multiple problems One is that the amendments don t generally prohibit same sex marriage they prohibit state recognition of same sex marriage If you want to understand the difference realize that DOMA prohibits federal recognition of SSM but that doesn t mean that the many marriages done in the various states aren t marriages or are causes for arrest or sanction And even within that the 30 state count is wrong California constitutionally requires the recognition of some same sex marriages per the state Supreme Court and the Hawaii amendment doesn t prohibit anything it merely permits the legislature to pass legislation,0

First of all the term Moore s law is widely used and it is not for us to change it The common usage of the term law extends beyond a proven scientific principle e g Murphy s law The real problem here seems to be coming up with a valid single benchmark for measuring progress in computing This parallels other problems in econometrics such as measuring poverty or inflation Often arbitrary decisions have to made to come up with a number that can be tracked however no one seems to have done this for the computer industry And arbitrary decisions can cause difficulties over long time periods The shift to onboard cache leads to higher transistor counts on the other hand the shift to hardwired instructions instead of microcode may have gone the other way What processor type to use as a benchmark and when in its life cycle is another problem And the goal itself keeps shifting Apple s switch to Intel was justified on Apple s realization that MIPS per watt is a more important consideration than MIPS per chip I therefore think it is misleading to say Moore s law is false It was never intended as a exact prediction but as a rough approximation and in that sense it seems to have held up pretty well,0

That it s sourced to the FBI is how it says according to the FBI If everything worked that way every single sourced statement would be according to Webster s Dictionary according to historian Bob Smith etc I think if anyone is allowed to designate a definition it s Webster s and if something is defined I don t think you should say in Webster s opinion the word boat means because Webster s is stating facts it knows not opinions On the same side of the coin if I want an expert analysis of a group like this I ll ask the FBI The term while inflammatory isn t just a tossed off opinion it s the result of tons of investigations trials arrests and research,0

Quit distorting what I said I didn t cite the article I put it in the References for the same reason you did it s the link to the Discovery Channel s own site for the Natasha Demkina Documentary You can t have it both ways Mr Skolnick it s either a link to the Documentary as you have claimed or it is not It s the same link What I said to Keith was something quite different than you misquote me as saying again the information I wanted to pull out of the article itself was the history of Natasha which has to include some of the hype surrounding her because that is the other side of the Natasha story which you want to suppress so the article only presents your side thus ignoring and negating NPOV and making the article entirely about CSICOP s belief of what Natasha is There are obviously thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people including scientists and researchers who believe Natasha has psi power that side must be represented in Wikipedia and not just with some piece of bogus empty fluff statement such as she has supporters If I were as biased as you claim I would be arguing that none of the CSICOP material should be included which as biased as that group is against anything paranormal I m not so sure they should be included as much more than a brief description and a reference link All I ve argued is that in the Wikipedia article on Natasha there is way too much emphasis and detail on the CSICOP test which far far exceeds the amount of information on the history and life of Natasha herself and there is no proper representation of the critics of the CSICOP test That this sounds unreasonable to you just goes to show your own bias,0
I have placed Template noncompliant atop this article per Wikipedia policy specifically NPOV citing verifiable authoritative sources whenever possible especially on controversial topics When a conflict arises as to which version is the most neutral declare a cool down period and tag the article as disputed hammer out details on the talk page and follow dispute resolution Don t disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point Given the controversial nature of this topic the entire article needs to use citations as often as possible preferably after vetting on Talk Japanese American internment Notably the unregistered users are significantly ahead in citing sources While and others dispute the authority of these sources they are not as effective at referencing sources to back up their edits and disputes In the spirit of full disclosure I am uncomfortable with the edits by the unregistered users and I am not thoroughly convinced as to their relevance However the unregistered users have eliminated some obviously POV pro reparations in their view copy on the pageeven as they have added POV elsewhere Finally as I have noted elsewhere on this talk page these disputes are not new to this article The disputes will not go away and they will not be resolved unless we collectively are able to produce an article that adheres to Wikipedia standards One last comment I considered reverting to a previous version before adding the template since it is just as applicable to earlier revisions I decided to use the most recent version which just happens to be the version preferred by the unregistered users I encourage everyone to retain the template in edits until these disputes are resolved,0

Bradley s comment on M M is attributed as his opinion cited to a self published source which is still a bit iffy sourcing wise but at least it is on the man s own BLP in defense of himself What Gavin Schmidt has to say about M M in a self published source that has nothing to do with this BLP is another matter entirely RealClimate is not a reliable source for use per BLP self published sources in any context other than one of its authors talking about themselves Such is not the case with the link you which to self promote The IP s reasoning is sound and based firmly in policy On a related not the fact that this is a link is irrelevant You cannot simply use links to self published sources as a means of circumventing BLP This should be obvious If that were the case then wiki link would be littered with such references something I would oppose on the same grounds,0

From the article Those who obtained their news primarily from Fox News were three times as likely to believe that evidence confirming WMD had been discovered in Iraq than those who relied on more liberal news outlets like PBS and NPR for news and one third more likely than those who primarily watched CBS The current text of the article makes no reference to the relative conservatism liberalism of Fox News or CBS I think it might be unfair to characterize PBS and NPR as liberal It seems like it is unnecessary to include this comment and is potential POV There is certainly no agreement on whether or not PBS and NPR are liberal I would propose changing this section to read Those who obtained their news primarily from Fox News were three times as likely to believe that evidence confirming WMD had been discovered in Iraq than those who relied on PBS and NPR for their news and one third more likely than those who primarily watched CBS If there are no objections I will make this change in a few days,0
Somebody anonymous keeps putting this stuff back with various personal comments stuff like Ellie does this and with awful formatting In the interests of keeping Wikipedia tidy I m going to wait a few hours until they ve stopped fiddling then remove it Unless of course the person reads the edit summary where I drew their attention to this discussion and perhaps explains here why they think this stuff is worth having I d like to emphasise that I don t have an axe to grind as it happens I m a citizen so I m positive towards the article in general and I m not involved in the fora and have no personal interest in who thinks who is in the government In any case I don t seem to be alone in thinking this stuff should go if I m reading the above comment correctly We could have a poll if only the anonymous editor would engage on here More edits from the anon user but still no engagement in the discussion so section removed again,0

Tried to find more refs It s interesting He s had a couple op eds published in the NYTimes But I find zero refs to him in the NYT news sections or any other RS And op eds don t necessarily confer notability as the NYT will publish something thought provoking from a non notable If we trimmed out all of the content based only on his blog or articles I don t think this article would pass notability But AfDs on political COATRACKs seem to usually result in keep Or maybe that s just my cynical memory at work In any case I ve tried and failed at finding secondary sources and have to agree that the entire Views section should be removed,0
I don t know how else to address the issue of perceived bias towards the AP team other than how I have several times already Some team has to be listed first and as I have stated the press overwhelmingly covers the AP team each season with very little mention of the other teams I have given you outside links to back up the assertion and all you have to do is a Google search of the term All Pro Team yet you consistently accuse me of editing based on personal bias Nor have I said anything about a permanent change or a consensus that is final I have repeatedly stated that consensus may change on the format of these articles but as it is now every editor who has chosen to express an opinion on this issue has done so in favor of the current format except you If more editors express reasons to change it then the issue of course can be revisited Your rationale is that not enough editors have expressed themselves to change a format that only you support I m sorry that stands logic on its head It doesn t get any thinner than one editor The note has been up for a day now on WT NFL we ll see if any speak up but until then please respect consensus as it is now,0

Nicely put rann irt anai nid My opinion is that a should go and that the article should be about the military history of the islands as opposed to the states Re the options above 1 is fine and my preference 2 is already mostly covered by Military history of the United Kingdom 3 is fine as it goes but British Isles is worldwide the common term 4 will lead to unneccessary duplication,0
Now here is the list of explanations for why most of the sentences I wrote spending 5days should be kept rather than new changes Probably I spend more time on the explanation than you on the edits I ll also restore my version which includes recent changes of other contributors again Why justify that something should not be changed when it is more reasonable to demand a justification that something of a version containing outcomes of discussion should be changed totally Stableness of an article is an aspect of a great article according to wikipedia I ve always included reasonable changes of other contributors You You just reverted alleged the other version of POV failed to explain why it should be POV reverted again alleged again failed to explain again Really fair Changes Why delete This article is about the computer game America s Army It is what America s Army is in one word a computer game It also explains that the article is about this game instead of the real army Is there a faster way of explaining it to the reader Why deleting that the game was developed by the US Army and some NPS scholars Should the reader be tricked into thinking the game was developed by some independent institute called MOVES Institute The MOVES institute is just a name for a little part of the army not a different organisation and might therefore mislead I count 4 links for US Army on one screen Please Make only links relevant to the context That s why I ve not linked many things that used to be The article was overlinked Why revert that too It makes no sense at all to write US then U S then US etc Keep consistency No matter if you like U S or US where s the difference except for two unnecessary dots they have the very same meaning and it s totally pointless to exchange these words if they don t need to be changed Never change for the sake of changing Should every reader who has read the article just exchange the words just because he loves dots Then comes the next one who hates dots and changes them and so on Same with the dates July 4 2002 or 4 July 2002 are changes that make no sense and are only preferences of one s own point of view Stableness belongs to the characteristic features of a great article not a train of thought Some subpage of wikipedia says US should be spelt U S while USA should be spelt USA That s why I changed them all to U S Why revert a jumble of US U S US US Why write Tactical shooter Tactical shooter is not a subgenre of first person shooter but a vague definition of sth that only MAY include fps It is more unknown than FPS and more vague You might just as well then use serious game computer game propaganda Advergame or whatever for genre So which can be used to keep genre NPOV If you click on the link to genre you see what only fits First person shooter Why did Bond not recognize that I almost forgot How long should this child s play continue Bond You re just faking support of versions that I disapprove of not because sth is wrong with them but because I disapprove of them You did not revert America s Army is the best simulation because although it is POV and would be deleted in the German version of this article within ONE minute you knew I wouldn t like the sentence Indeed you even reverted Ele s version twice But apart from that brilliant info box Bond Why delete AA It is the abbreviation for America s Army Even the cover proves that Why delete that Why delete propaganda and recruiting tool They re the reasons for the game the answer to WHY for the game It is without one of the most important questions a reader could have if not THE most important Excluding the question would without any doubt make the article completely biased I told you If you feel it doesn t fit propaganda read through the first two archives of the talk page and the definition of propaganda I m sure as hell not going to spend another 100kb of text for every new contributor one that issue If you like the term alleged case of use it for every picture you find for propaganda and see if this POV term Or how about this 911 is an alleged case of a human being You see how it sounds But without any points accusing me of POV twice and using it as an excuse to restore real POV Sorry but this hypocrisy inflames me Why delete the fact that it is fully financed by taxes It s nowhere else in the article Why mention the Navy in the opening paragraph Are they important AT ALL I put them to history where they will still get more space than the lack of relevance should actually allow Why delete the short description of realism in America s Army The game is a statement no matter if you regard AA as an accurate portrayal of reality or an intentional misrepresentation of reality It is only intended as a statement in the guise of a game not simply as a game no one would spend million of dollars for a game without any intention and the game s intention is delivering the statement Now a statement can only be between true and false What is true represents reality it is realistic it is truly What is untrue is unrealistic What is in truth is in reality I ve tried to keep the description of reality truth in America s Army fair Is it not Why only write inspired by CS I ve tried to describe the extremely close connection between the games months ago till the fact that the devs say they had the game actually taken as model convinced all Why play that down by words such as inspired Why put the game s popularity away It needs no section What should that section all include In the otherwise idiotic and uninformative IMO CS article that was called a good example of video game article popularity is also summarized in the first section Also your depiction of popularity neglected the contrast between the devs number of players and the real number of players Why delete the picture of training Compared to the only 2 3 hours a player would spend on training the multiplayer part is totally dominating this can be seen in the number of average honor 34 However I think the proportion still deserves a picture The picture taken depicts the first training level the level that really everyone who has played the game must have seen The article surely should not become a picture book but pictures enliven the text Just look at propaganda Beautiful isn t it It s certainly one of the reasons why it became a feautured article see its talk page Picture description Why did you revert Difference in depiction of the same player the left as the US Army and the left as OPFOR What s right then Such changes reverts just prove that you re ignoring what I edit Doesn t round start of the game s most often played map explain more than User interface during gameplay Why did you revert V I P Longer words such as USA should be written without dots in Wikipedia according to the same source that said US should be written with dots Why is the professor suddenly only of the NY University Should the reader be tricked into thinking it is just a student of the university Why did you delete the correct interpretation of what Galloway said Leaving out negative aspects of the US Army would be one way of intentional lack of realism What about the fidelty of content or the restricted code You didn t read through the text did you Why did you include the sentence about Hitler Was he crucial to understand the next sentence Anyway It further demonstrates the propaganda behind so I left it like it Why did you change that about military entertainment complex Three or four sources of academic articles included that aspect and isn t it logical,0
You violated 3RR earlier today reverting FOUR TIMES In less than an hour I reverted only three at that time You kept doing it not caring And with the same lame lies of vandalism Now you still say it s my own conclusion Stop the BS I ve tried to be somewhat civil but I had enough of your neuroticism and bothersomeness over something like this The Holy Spirit was NOT discussed to the same extent as the specific matter of Christ s identity role and relation to the Father It s stated IN THAT VERY PARAGRAPH in the article SOURCED ALREADY It s NOT my own conclusion That s another lie I put three sources already that you arbitrarily conveniently call not reliable Because lol not peer reviewed As if WP policy demands that all RS be peer reviewed Let s lose the nonsense already No matter what source is put in there characters like you JUST DON T WANT THAT INFORMATION STATED THAT WAY IN THE ARTICLE Because I can see from your page that you re a hyper trinitarian and it bothers you that the full fledged trinity doctrine went through all that crazy debate and councils etc to be fully developed You re gonna honestly deny that psychologically that s part of why you re so against this You won t like ANY ref for that so who are we kidding Listen Nicea did NOT conclude a co equal trinity per se and many Trinitarians don t like that fact so they d rather suppress it with BS alibi front excuses I won t put up with it I found three valid sources no matter what you or that other editor say Maybe not the best in the world but at least 1 of them is valid enough Your circular arguments I don t accept This is NOT my own conclusion Yes the Holy Spirit was mentioned in Nicea but NOT nearly to the same extent You wanna believe otherwise You prove it with sources then And get off my back and stop disrespecting me and stop violating WP policy all the time You did 4RR in one hour so you technically should be blocked And you blatantly lied in your edit comments calling what I did vandalism I wanted to be civil and maintain a measure of WP etiquette You re not making it easy sir Because you continue with this Enough please RS don t need to be peer reviewed Stop making up rules that don t really exist Thank you,1

This is your interpretation Maharishi says so often that Guru Dev is a man He is very clear that all masters mentioned in the puja are men Also gratitude can be expressed in so many ways For example it is a public fact that Maharishi has given the title His divinity to Guru Dev but he is still clear that Guru Dev is a man It is just an expression of admiration The only way they participate in the Hindu worhsip service is to bring a flower and a fruit which are offered to Hindu Gods and Goddesses There is some participation However it is not true that there are offering to God and Goddesses Again it is a ceremony of gratitude to the masters of the Vedic Tradition which are men Every other interpretation is just in your mind The Truth is out there If I follow your logic the judicial system of some countries is a religion because every judge must go through a ceremony before taking office a ceremony that has its origin in the culture of the country which is often very religious See just for an example The following oath to become a physician which is still used in some countries is even a better example Hippocratic Oath You might say that it is not the samething but this would be your viewpoint Really the instructor is required to perform the ceremony for a similar purpose You are preaching to the converted I am quite clear that religion shows up in many supposdily secular settings Oh wow the supposedly secular setting expression suggests that you are not convinced that our health care and legal systems are not religions They are clearly not religious at all So there is no roon for the supposedly Does that make it a religion I don t know If you want to believe a judicial system IS a religion go for it I am saying the opposite My point is that we have two precedents that show that this kind of ceremonies in an organization do not imply that the organization is a religious organization Please note nowhere have I claimed TM is a religion The facts are TM has some religious components to it Whine about it accuse other institutions of being religions etc We do progress Now we have established that there is no argument to support the clain that TM is a religion The next step is to establish the difference with a religion and put the emphasis on it This is will be the way to reach a consensus Dude the TM movement calls the ceremony a puja complain to them about it You say that puja means an Hindu invocation to gods or something like that However the word puja existed before the Hinduism religion It has a different meaning Many words have different meaning in different context In the context of TM it just means a ceremony of gratitude Whether you like it or not if you learned TM you participated supplied the major offerings the fruit flowers and handkerchief for the puja And you were required to kneel at the end before a picture of a Hindu Guru after chanting was done which affirmed that he was in fact God This is false Nobody is required to kneel If you were to stand in front of a Catholic altar were required by the priest to bring offerings required to hold a palm frond while he recites prayers and finally were asked forcefully to kneel down to a picture of Jesus wouldn t you be a participant The ceremony requires some participation and so what Again it is just a ceremony of gratitude It helps the teacher recall that he is not teaching his own technique but a technique that he received from a tradition of masters It protects the purity of the teaching It is similar to the purpose of the ceremony to become a physician or a judge,0

Thank you for your suggestions Given my age I m flattered to be thought of as green Guess you should go back and read the rules for deletion before you go nominating anything that in your infinite wisdom isn t notable ehough A little quick on the draw aren t you Its obvious you are making this personal and the earlier comment at your talk page Otherwise you are just a fly in the ointment and I will continue to remove them maintenance templates If you continue to put them back I will also contact Wiki management directly to complain about the harrassment don t represent you or the article well nor have the multiple times you ve in effect vandalized the piece by removing templates without adequately responding to their issues It s important to assume good faith but your mode of operation especially for a presumably novice contributor is a bit willful I ve started numerous articles and always line up reliable sources before they re begun If not the articles would be challenged and with good reason If the subject of the article you ve started is deemed notable it will be keptall this has been explained numerous times by myself and another editor and links have been provided to the pages detailing Wikipedia guidelines particularly wiki link and wiki link wiki link is relevant too And if it s deleted you can recreate it though if the same issues remain a similar outcome is likely The article is heartfelt and well written and I gather that you re rather closely involved with a person or people relating to it which often compromises objectivity If I ve been quick to nominate this then that will out in the wash,0

Some of your posts here are dreadfully confused over the matter I utterly oppose your removal of this information I am quite happy to give sources Just to clear a basic point that seems to have lost itself on you Blitzkrieg was not used by the German Army or popular press at all prior to 1940 after the defeat of France Even then it was not used very often by the Army The word entered military and popular terminology because of the British press It had and has no root in military art or in German popular culture It was just a popular phrase used by non military people to describe battle That is the point,0
Paul is fundamentally important Paul is the earliest written witness in the bible Paul s epistles are the earliest known Christian writings If Paul himself did not think Jesus existed but was in fact a gnostic allegory then this means that 100 of the evidence points to the first Christians being gnostic and not believing Jesus is real If this is the case then Jesus being real must be a later invention Therefore he cannot actually have been real Paul is fundamental to arguments of historicity,0
Regarding the citation to American Anthropological Association Statement on Race Aaanet org 1998 05 17 with reference to When used as a biological term race describes genetically divergent populations of humans that can be marked by common phenotypic and genotypic traits I had read the AAA statement authored by Smedley some time ago I didn t recall her supporting any kind of biological basis for race nor did I see the same on rereading it Perhaps editing over time without updating references has led to some anomaly,0

Those aren t about Litvinenko but about the much covered apartment bombings You found opinion pieces they re all editorials that labeled the allegations as a conspiracy theory which means they personally dismiss them This controversy surrounding the apartment bombings is not widely considered to be a conspiracy theory since much evidence has also been brought in support There s also been many public figures and respected journalists who ve voiced their support for the allegations such as John McCain and we don t put in his lead section that he fancies conspiracy theories either Just like him Litvinenko s work didn t just cover the bombings As for the change I don t see much improvement no You re comparing it to your idea that he s not a dissident but this is inaccurate As a good reference the google news archives gives 1 350 hits for litvinenko dissident whereas it gives only 7 hits for litvinenko conspiracy theorist and the terms there never refer to litvinenko As an extra Litvinenko conspiracy theories gives 77 hits I went trough all of them and none of them refer to his work as that but instead speak of the theories surrounding his dead mostly the ones contradicting the british version such as how he poisoned himself but in some cases also those that cover the official investigation though they are mostly right after his death,0

Looking at that page is useful The context there is vital And possibly multiple sources which should be easy to find if it clearly was a religious war Your source does deal with one thing that concerns me when it talks about playing the religious card which is why I said that simply a government statement wouldn t suffice That page gives examples of armed struggles labelled as religious wars which were basically ethnic conflicts I d say that religious war religious confrontation or some such clear statement is required and perhaps that it be found in multiple sources And there s another issue even where religion plays some part does that make it a religious war Again we need to look carefully at sources and probably take it case by case I note that the source for the Saxon wars seems gone but I ve found this which needs to be in the main article also perhaps,0
I have this page on a watch and I have to say I was shocked SA wiped such a big chunk of the article Non standard cosomologies pop up fairly often in science magazines and several pages on WP essentially apologize for the cosmological red shift not being among the kinds of red shift you first encounter when you study the topic As such the deleted text stands as an explanation of why you can develop a non standard cosmology from first principles That a non standard cosomology relies on these principles does not invalidate the principles I m okay with protection until wholesale destruction of the article is under control,0

These opening paras really are pretty bad trying to cram a bunch of facts each no doubt important to the individual who put it there into what ought to be a preliminary statement For example the concluding sentences about the bomb affected persons ought to go much later in the article The stated goal sentence in the first para probably should come out or move into the para about the U S view Where it says the planned invasion comes later it should say months later Any feelings on this I would just go ahead and make a start but I don t want to get into another mindless reversion war Just trying to move the ball forward here,0

Leaving aside the merits of the article itself your presentation of it was inaccurate You wrote that the authors concluded that there was a proven role for high doses of Ascorbic acid in the amelioration of cancer associated inflammation In fact they concluded no such thing Instead they discussed this hypothesis as one they found biologically plausible and worthy of further investigation For example the authors write that while ascorbate deficiency has been associated with inflammation to our knowledge no interventional studies in cancer patients have been performed to assess the capacity of AA ascorbic acid administered i v to inhibit chronic inflammation So the authors explicitly write that AA has never even been tested in this capacity yet you present the article as evidence of a proven role for vitamin C I ll assume that the misrepresentation of the article is a mistake rather than a deliberate misuse of sources but I would assume that the discrepancy between your edit and the article s actual content motivated Orangemarlin to revert your edit,0

I deleted the claim that the original skins were dock workers This is largely a myth since most of the first skins were teens in school not dock workers And of those who did have jobs they worked at many different types of places not just the docks I also deleted the links to articles about neo Nazis since this article is about the skinhead culture not about extremist politics Those links are appropriate for the Nazi Skinheads article not this one I also just noticed this on the docks of Jamaica where the term Skinhead came from in the mid to late 1950s This is totally false The term skinhead originated in England not Jamaica And I don t know where the idea came from that the Jamaican immigrants who influenced skinhead culture were dock workers back in Jamaica That s the first time I ve seen someone claim that and I really doubt that it s true Spylab,0

I feel that the IP editor s behaviour is catastrophic I do not in any way deny their right to want to change things and to improve the encyclopaedia What I detest though is the single issue crusader approach in which an editor decides that Something Is Wrong And Must Be Fixed and goes off and makes the same edit across 963 articles without any discussion If they are an experienced editor then they should know better if they are not then they need it explaining to them that this is not the way to behave I know that most of us here are probably somewhere on some spectrum or another but blimey when someone edits that dysfunctionally I wonder it they should be editing at all How can they be SO insensitive as to not see what they are doing and that their one issue thing is just splashing all over the careful work of many others It cheeses me off I feel that people should never but never start on a crusade like this without consensus and that that consensus should be reached if possible at the appropriate project page or similar The Any editor wanting mass changes has to be honest and say I want to change remove whatever every appearance of whatever what do you think To just launch in like this is I feel disruptive dishonest disingenuous not good in summary I ve seen it so many times and it s very depressing Every change of this type by this editor should be reverted without further discussion and they should be forced back to an appropriate forum to discuss what they want to do If they achieve consensus for it great Really seriously that s great Then they can just put it in the edit summary removing X per discussion at Y it gives so much more strength and support to what they want to do But without it it s just a mess It may or may not be a good change I personally don t like it but so what but to make it over a range of articles needs consensus Revert revert No offence meant best wishes to all Struck some intemperate comments,0

I admit I find it hard to get definitive information on this Some while ago we had a very dogmatic Jain contributor who insisted that the left facing design was evil see discusions above and is universally recognised as such in India At the time I left a message on the Hinduism page asking for input on this from Hindu contributors but none was forthcoming We could really do with some knowledgable input here The sources I am aware of date back to the swastika sauwastika debate of the mid nineteenth century see sauwastika article when a claim is made that the left facing design is inauspicious in some way But later writers deny that The whole thing gets further complicated by the Nazi use of the right facing design so that that orientation then came to be seen as evil Some occultists like to argue that the Nazis were in some mystical way invoking dark forces by their choice of this orientation It seems that you agree with the view that the right facing design is evil It would be very helpful if you could provide sources for this view Who are these knowledgable Hindu priests who accept this view What are the sources for this belief Please please can we have some clear information on this matter rather than just assertions All I can say for certain is that there was discussion among 19th century European scholars about this and that I have seen images of ancient swastikas oriented both ways some are reproduced in the article,0

However Judaism and Buddhism are widely used terms in academia and elsewhere This is a coinage as admitted by the creator of this article It is not for Wikipedia to create new words by writing articles about them Yes the word is used but it only exists in publications of Modern Assyrians The religion of ancient Assyria is the proper domain of academic Assyriologists so academic terminology should be used in preference to the coinages of non academic groups The arguments that any kind of ism is a valid subject for a Wikipedia article is clearly spurious as is the argument that insisting on academic terminology in an encyclopaedia smacks of the intelligentsia Please go ahead and talk to AINA it is a matter for the defence,0

In 1979 the Baltimore Orioles won the division title I assume you mean 1978 After 162 games they were tied with the Yankees and a 163rd game a playoff game was held to decide the winner because only one of the two could go to the post season In 2005 as with 2001 in the NL Central there was no need for a playoff game because both teams already qualified for the post season Had the Indians swept the White Sox this past weekend there would have to have been a playoff scenario That s why the news reported after this past Saturday that the Yankees win along with the Indians loss gave the Yankees the division championship Red Sox Nation can rightly say they finished with the same record as the Yankees in 2005 but they are incorrect if they claim it to be a division co champion There is no such thing not now and not in 1978 either,0

Thanks for clearing that up Alberuni If Israel uses the term disputed territories in a special sense than the Arab Israeli conflict series of articles should note this special usage Also the point of view of the UN should be given prominence like According to the United Nations the West Bank is an occupied territory under international law The Israeli Supreme Court began using the term belligerent occupation in June 2004 A gradually shrinking remnant of advocates continue to protest the designation occupied territory on the grounds that Israel seized the area from Jordan which Israel claims had no right to them in the first place We should definitely mention the UN s point of view along with other prominent parties who agree with it After that we have two choices A mention other POV which disagrees with the UN or B omit dissenting POV completely,0
Quite frankly I don t see why the criticism section of Chomsky is so large in the first place already the criticism section is larger than any other section in this article I agree I think this article should be a neutral review of Chomsky s scientific contributions as well as a mention of his critical analysis of US foreign policy Why is the Faurison affair even in here That ad hominem has been proven ridiculous numerous times What does it have to do with his political theories Chomsky the man or his Linguistic theories That is why Wiki will never be taken as seriously as Encarta or other online Encyclopedias they don t include such rubbish Second why are basic facts left out of the Faurison affair Such as how Chomsky came to sign the petition and the fact that dozens of other professors signed it as well Why isn t Chomsky s analysis of the Faurison affair posted if you re going to include it We re only getting one side of the story here maybe some of it should be deleted,0

The behavior being exhibited by Red Baranof and Ryulong is simply unacceptable Each of these editors Ryulong especially are actively working to minimize or effectively erase evidence that there are women and minorities supporting GamerGate despite it being well established in numerous reliable sources It is so extreme that they have have tried to erase all mention of women who support GamerGate receiving rape and death threats despite this being acknowledged in numerous reliable sources as well leaving only material about men who support GamerGate facing threats and harassment What they have tried to do with the notyourshield section is to attribute every statement about women and minorities being part of GamerGate so as to cast doubt on the veracity of the information and erase what they can t spin in such a manner seeing as the Washington Post acknowledges as fact that there are indeed women and minorities in GamerGate Ryulong even takes this to the point of trimming the caption on the Sommers image to avoid mentioning her statement that the gamer generation is the least prejudiced generation Nothing they have done is supported by policy or sourcing It is pure POV pushing,0

Pertinent observation Boris The problem is a specific consensus was arrived at after much peer review and debate The present consensus is a specific conclusion Conceivably more evidence could theoretically pop up tomorrow morning that blows Scientific consensus out of the water invalidating such an article title whereas Scientific opinion would continue to be validly descriptive of this article even if countervailing evidence were found content would change to reflect the new evidence of course Sticking to the broader term Scientific opinion seems best Interesting idea though,0
I assert that s proposal is a restatement of a topic which was already debated and that consensus has already been found This discussion should not be happening without checking to see whether this is a new proposal I say that it is not and that the lede should not be casually changed in this way because hundreds of people have already given input and settled on the way it is now I do not want to see debate about whether this proposal is good or bad that is in the archives I would like to see a reason why the previous consensus should be ignored Such a reason has not yet been offered,0

The section dealing with Li s date of birth did not actually describe the nature of the debate for instance it did not even explain that May 13 is the birth date of Sakyamuni or state what the Chinese government thinks the implications are Zujine tried to fix this and Shrigley reverted him for reasons unknown I have again tried to fix it such that it actually tells us something useful The old version seemed focused on the question of whether or not Li changed his date of birth in the government records But that is not source of the controversy Li agrees that he changed the records The actual debate centers on the question of whether his purpose was to simply correct the record or whether he was trying to bolster his spiritual authority and misrepresent himself by aligning his date of birth to that of Sakyamuni The Chinese government argues the latter and Li argues the former This being the case in my edit I stated clearly that Li did change the government records and provided his explanation of why he did this I left in the background about the Changchun faction even though I frankly don t see how it helps clarify the issue I also added a note to explain how the Chinese government has attempted to make use of the birth date change as that was previously lacking Two final notes Chinese government sources have actually given two dates of birth for Li July 7 and July 27 David Ownby notes this discrepancy and I have also now noted it Also the old version relied on primary sources namely Chinese government websites Primary sources should be used with extreme caution in BLP and this is all the more so when those primary sources are described as propaganda by the reliable sources I have removed it in accordance with WP BLP,0

OK so why don t we present the dispute instead of presenting one side s point of view only And the book in my opinion IS reliable even if many left wing people do not want to believe in what it contains because it is too shocking for them Let s mention that many historians think that the data are exaggerated This is true And it is true that the book says so I m trying to make a compromise while you keep imposing your point of view,0
Plot section,0
The article as it is promotes a POV namely the usage of the term Danubian principalities over Romanian principalities Probably there is not possible to make a fair balance between the two terms so my suggestion is to split the article in two parts in the same or in two different articles corresponding to two time spans one for 14th late 18th century Romanian principalities one for late 18 mid 19th centuries Danubian principalities Also the links in Wikipedia article should reflect that i e an article on John Hunyadi or Stephen the Great should refer to the two principalities as Romanian principalities while an article on 1821 revolution should refer to them as Danubian principalities Some may argue this is OR historians prefering one term or another but I see no other way to balance them I welcome any other suggestions,0

Bona fide readers of the arguments here and above may note the editing history of Rescue opera Here is the original version with Grove citation with nowiki tags Here is the current version after the citation was removed and the level of the article sadly like so many others now reduced Note that the first sentence of the new lead was a popular genre of opera in the late 18th and early 19th century directly contradicts the statement further down Rescue opera was not a contemporary term,0

As far as I am concerned I see no reasons to suggest that the GRG is falling apart last time I checked a case was verified by the organisation only yesterday filter via Date Added Not only is that the case I have also noticed that the GRG continues to be referred to by a n international variety of RS such as its post Dr Coles activity therefore seems obvious and existent to me As to why it has no verified supercentenarians born later than 9 June 1904 on its list that is a question not suited for a Wikipedia talk page I suggest you take a look at the GRG website itself where you will find plenty of options to contact the organisation What I can tell you is that referring to 25 living men over 110 is an example of gender bias the current list shows that the majority of living supercentenarians is women In other words trying to include as many men as possible selection bias favouring men would lead to skewed data which is not what science is about,0

The Japan Times article is from the Opinion section which means it s not suitable for any factual claims and unless Lance Braman is a particularly notable person with high notability in the field of Japanese Gaijin issues then his opinion isn t important enough to include see WP UNDUE The other link looks like it s probably a reliable source given the bios of the site authors the question though is what could you say Bsaically about the only thing I could imagine saying is something like Robert C Neff a foreign reporter and business executive living in Japan believes that Arudou s complaints about Japanese onsen are generally exaggerating stating that he has personally stayed at over 200 onsen in Japan That statement also seems to border on being WP UNDUE because it s really just the opinion of one particular business person in Japan Was there some other way of saying it that you think might be more due Am I missing something in the article,0

Collingwood26 I would be interested in seeing a source for the claim that John Howard started the withdrawal of Australian troops from Iraq As I recall Howard spent much of 2006 and 2007 denying that any such plan existed In mid 2007 there were rumours that Howard planned to ambush Rudd by announcing a withdrawal from Iraq but this was denied by the government One of the Wikileaks cables sent just a few weeks before the 2007 election stated that Howard was committed to keeping Australian troops there with only the notion that he wished to have combat troops in the Overwatch Battle Group succeeded by military trainers as soon as possible as a mild aspiration towards ending Australian involvement I can neither find nor recall any indication that Howard had in any way outlined or even considered an exit strategy and timeline other than making an aspirational when the job is done statements The timeline for withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan was outlined by ISAF and the Afghan government at the Lisbon summit in 2010 so while this would have been administered by the Gillard government commencing mid 2012 I wouldn t give Julia Gillard credit for the withdrawal but just because Tony Abbott s election happened to coincide with the end of an 18 month transition process initiated under the previous government it is certainly inappropriate to count this withdrawal as one of Abbott s achievements or actions as prime minister,0

That is a misrepresentation of wikipedia policies that doesn t take into account WP FRINGE WP NPOV and WP UNDUE In articles about fringe topics fringe viewpoints still only get the amount of coverage that they merit relative to the mainstream This content is ludicrously biased in favor of the fringe theory and only tangentially mentions the mainstream view sometimes even openly casting it into doubt Wikipedia is not the medium for providing extended media coverage of fringe science as has been established in multiple arbcom decisions by now this has absilutely nothing to do with censorship but about writing an encyclopedia and not a laundry list of rejected hypotheses,0

The real reason why soccer is not popular in the US is that advertisers have to wait until half time to screen commercials making it financially unattractive As the Bedford Reader puts it The reason stems partly from the basic nature of commercial television which exists not to inform and entertain but to sell During most major sporting events on television football baseball basketball producers can take advantage of natural interruptions in the action to broadcast sales pitches or if the natural breaks occur too infrequently the producers can contrive time outs for the sole purpose of airing lucrative commercials But soccer is played in two soled halves of forty five minutes each not even injury to a player is cause for a time out How then to insert the requisite number of commercial breaks without resorting to false fouls or other questionable tactic After CBS aired a soccer match in 1967 players reported according to Stanley Frank that before the game the referee had instructed them to stay down every nine minutes The resulting hue and cry rose all the way to the House Communications Subcommittee From that day to this no one has been able to figure out how to screen advertising jingles during a televised soccer game The result is that commercial television has treated soccer almost as if didn t exist,0

The relevant portions in all these sources are in English Their reliability is debatable The first website is run by academics and the paper is written by an academic but it s strikingly unprofessional as a publication with broken English and inline citations to a random unsigned text from the web The passage on the Italian website is of unclear attribution The Oxford Handbook is a solid but not specialist source This characterization is found in the chapter A Sociotheological Approach to Understanding Religious Violence and the authors don t seem to have expertise in the history of science To summarize we can say that this characterization appears in some reputable publications but it s not clear that it s a view held by specialists in the history of science Rather than simply arguing about this vague father of title I think it would be more helpful to describe the actual theory proposed by Avicenna based on specialist sources Here s a concise discussion which explains his concept of mayl and how it relates to what later came to be known as momentum,0

The definition of zionism on the first line is given as Jewish political movement that in its broadest sense has supported the self determination of the Jewish people in a sovereign Jewish national homeland It misses out the point that it has to be in biblical israel As was stated in the 27th congress 1978 The Congress also amended the Jerusalem program of 1951 which had defined Zionist goals The new text read as follows The aims of Zionism are The unity of the Jewish people and the centrality of Israel in its life the ingathering of the Jewish people in its historical homeland Eretz Yisrael through aliyah from all lands the strengthening of the State of Israel founded on the prophetic ideals of justice and peace the preservation of the identity of the Jewish people through the fostering of Jewish and Hebrew education and of Jewish spiritual and cultural values the protection of Jewish rights everywhere It is a very focal point that the state in is the historical homeland and it grossly incorrect that this point was left out,0
I do not think that the capital letters are necessary I am and others are capable of understanding what you are saying without them As to the matter it was being discussed on the talk page and despite the disagreement of other editors Thunderer removed the information again which seems to me to be an act of spite That is not simply content editing that is editing to prove or push a point That sounds like vandalism to me I fail to see how reverting such an edit while discussion is still taking place can be considered outside the bounds,0

I have attempted to verify a phrase in the lead section of the article but it appears that the phrase doesn t accurately represent its source in fact it contradicts its source The phrase says that an unseen character advances the action of the plot in a significant way and whose absence enhances their effect on the plot According to the citation that follows it the source is an essay The Presence of Absence Catalytic and Omnipresent Offstage Characters in Modern American Drama written by Safi Mahmoud Mahfouz published in the literary journal Midwest Quarterly The problem is that first part of the phrase in the lead section claims that an unseen character advances the action of the plot but what the source says instead is that the ones who advance the plot are not the unseen characters but those who are seen by the audience In a sense that s the opposite The second part of the same phrase I believe has a similar problem it states that an unseen character is one whose absence enhances their effect on the plot The source doesn t actually say that and it doesn t refer to the plot Instead says that absence may affect how the unseen characters appear or seem to the audience For comparison here is again the phrase in this WP article An unseen character is one who advances the action of the plot in a significant way and whose absence enhances their effect on the plot And here is the source passage in the essay by Mahfouz Those we do not glimpse on stage are still there because they motivate the actors to take a certain course of action and advance the plot but their physical presence is unnecessary In fact their absence may make them appear more powerful to us simply because we only know them by inference The source itself is fine and is used elsewhere in the article Although there is a minor problem in the reference to O Neil in the History section of the article where it credits O Neil with establishing the absent character in the American Theatre the source doesn t go that far The sources for all of the references to this essay including the above quote can be found in an excerpt at this website I think what happened is that the phrase may have been in good faith simply misread or misinterpreted and then perhaps adjusted to fit in with the lead section or adjusted to have it become a paraphrase I have objected to the phrase in the lead section for other reasons I felt that it was a needless restriction that may invite debate about what examples belong or don t belong in the article Because I hadn t read the source I wasn t sure that the phrase was being used by the article in a way that the source uses it But now I think that it can be considered original research,0
Don t be sorry at all Your tone was not pompous at all and you make good points about awards and such This is a first for me If it were a NYT writer who was being considered for editor in chief but passed over that fact would probably be noteworthy right But this is about a Wikipedian so hmmmmmm was my thought I debated with myself and then figured it natural to be in the article If he were an administrator would that fact be notable enough to go in the article Is this about adminship or the not passing I still don t get why other sources would be needed and I also don t get the context thing either but that s okay Best,0
North8000 and Andrewrp you seem to be under the mistaken impression that all the other editors just don t like the sources you re presenting for political social reasons despite that repeatedly being told that the issue is they are unacceptable for sourcing a Wikipedia article I d like you to use Wikipedia Reliable sources Noticeboard a noticeboard that is neutral and looks only at the source presented and what it is being used to source Frankly the insistence on using what are some very unreliable sources concerns me as to what sources you have been using on other articles But for now please use the noticeboard if you still want to use any source here In that way this page isn t wasting your time and you ll have neutral editors looking only at the quality of sources,0

The expulsion of Cham Albanians from Greece was the forced migration of almost the entire Muslim Cham Albanian population from parts of the region of western Epirus toward the end of the Second World War to Albania 1944 1945 It occurred during the military operations of the Allied forces and after the withdrawal of the German units from the region It was carried out by the Allies through elements of the Resistance National Republican Greek League EDES forces with the acquiescence of local British intelligence operatives During the process some 1 200 Cham Albanians were murdered and massacred and the estimated amount of Cham Albanians expelled from Epirus to Albania and Turkey varies figures of 14 000 19 000 20 000 or 25 000 After the members of the community settled in Albania instead of being treated as victims and have their rights protected the local regime took a very distrustful view towards them and proceeded with arrests and exiles The Cham Albanians thereafter were labelled as reactionaries and suffered a certain degree of persecution within Albania during the communist era Agree,0

In the section on the 1975 Haicheng earthquake this edit removed a qualifier putative story so that the text now makes a declarative statement that s tudy of seismic activity in the region lead the Chinese authorities to issue various warnings This suggests deliberate action taken on the basis of sound knowledge being the story put forward by the Chinese authorities promoting both Chinese science and the political leadership and uncritically accepted by many However Wang et al 2006 found that this narrative is incorrect that there was no short term prediction and that it was the foreshocks alone that triggered the final decisions of warning and evacuation On this basis the quasi official story is not true and suitable qualification is required to maintain objectivity,0

I don t think that I ve done anything that would get me blocked You should not judge me on any of the previous history you re not aware of it and neither is it related to this case Again why are you reminding me of getting a block It is obvious that histories and diffs are saved in wikipedia Whether I remove content from my talk page or archive it is completely upto me It is trivial that any one can see it from the history so it will not in any case reflect bad on me in context of hiding,0

I believe the appropriateness of polls in this article is under dispute If it s generally agreed that they should be removed then this under Governorship should also go She took office on December 4 2006 and has been very popular with Alaska voters Polls taken in 2007 early in her term showed her with a 93 and 89 popularity among all voters 75 which led some media outlets to call her the most popular governor in America 65 75 A poll taken in late September 2008 after Palin was named to the national Republican ticket showed her popularity in Alaska at 68 76 Might I respectfully suggest that others comb through more of these sources I believe that the messed up citations might be a result of well meant but heavy and perhaps careless editing Regards,0

Hi per WP BRD I boldly deleted a paragraph reverted my edit and I made a thoughtful comment explaining my reasons Before I commented I checked Bradford and various other sources I have at hand You ve made what I think are a couple of fairly rude replies here which was then refactored here It s probably best not to refactor and best not to personalize If someone else wants to join the conversation I think that would be a good idea As it now stands the second paragraph could do with a rewrite But I don t want to get into a long and acrimonious talk page discussion which does nothing but prevent improving the material under discussion,0

As it stands the lead states Without a valid passport Snowden reportedly remained stranded At that point we insert an inline citation to a BBC article where the word stranded appears only once in a photo caption that reads Edward Snowden is reportedly stranded in a Moscow airport transit zone The BBC does not attribute stranded to the Kremlin or anyone else It is strictly in the BBC s own voice So the question becomes Who is reporting that Snowden is stranded Is it the BBC If so why don t they just say Snowden is stranded It s a shell game The whole thing is bogus,0

Jesus is the Savior That role is fundamental to his identity as Christ the Son The lead and the article in general don t pay much attention to Jesus as savior In Christianity isn t savior a distinctive role for Christ Isn t the point of Jesus that those who believe in him are saved and have eternal life The lead talks about Christians worshiping him but it s more than that Christians rely on him to save them from hell right To gain eternal life The lead talks about Jesus returning but it doesn t explain the circumstances He s coming back to judge the living and the dead right Judgment Day I know that these days lots of Christian groups don t talk about Judgment Day or hell as much as they used to but it seems like we re missing a vital element in understanding Jesus Or at least the Christian perspective on Jesus which is notable,0

not a problem Please read wiki link specifically the section on wiki link The edit speaks at length to criticize Narconon s use of niacin and offer scientific evidence to debunk Narconon s claims but it does so by bringing in wiki link which back up Narconon s practices using Niacin bringing in separate wiki link which talk about the effects of Niacin and based on these two claims the edit makes the separate claim that Narcanon is wrong without bringing up any reliable sources to back up this third statement thus using wikipedia to engage in wiki link through wiki link of two wiki link Hope this helps Cheers now if you can find a reliable source which states BOTH that narconon uses a drug bomb AND that the effects are harmful that is perfectly fine but even then you can only summarize that article it doesn t open the door to insert a bunch of research that has nothing to do with narconon,0

Mr Matlock like many other interpreters misinterprates Abraham to be a brahman No infact Abraham s earlier name was Abhiru and the word abraham seems to be derived from Abhiram Abhira in Sanskrit Moslems refers to him as Ibrahim Maybe Brahmin too is derived from it If Historians could prove this it will just twist the present notion of Abhira being born through Brahmin to Brahmin being born through Abhir and this is highly likely for there are references of Abhira living in india perhaps even before arrival of aryans and if statement of Bhagwad Gita is to be believed that Krishna in past incarnation has given knowledge to manu the first man on earth after Noah flood It is likely that tribe of Krishna had survived this flood preserving all the ancient knowledge,0

About 10 days ago I had suggested to the two major writers of this article that they each write out a full version of the article as they would like to see it I did this because it was clear that they simply weren t communicating with each other and the differences were deep seated As I understand it the 2 versions are ready by and Draft Samuel Fraunces by I ll suggest that readers take their time and review each they are pretty long and detailed Then we should select one version as the base article to be used here At that point we can discuss whether sections can be replaced into the base article from the non selected article Given that we can find 2 or 3 folks to read both articles we should be back on track with an article acceptable to the majority within a few days,0

Funny I always find that it s much better to err on the side of length Shortening any article is easy even with minimal knowledge in the field and can always be done without much trouble if you re a decent copyeditor Finding more information on the other hand is a huge chore requiring research doublechecking with the rest of the article and other articles cite scavenging etc I d pick an overlong article over a stub anyday both are obviously far from ideal but one s much easier to make ideal than the other at least without a major effort involved,0
As usual you don t give a constructive reply you don t give reliable sources for your claims that usually are in conflict with observable facts and you confirm that you miss fact based knowledge on the topic But we already know that you seem to miss important knowledge about UNIX in the time before 1990 and thus may not be able to understand that some of the modifications on UNIX introduced by AT T after splitting off USL just serve the purpose to support the slow UNIX V7 filesystem that was in use by AT T until the late 1980s Those changes have been counter productive with modern filesystems The data structures in terminfo are such a relict from the 1970s that tried to fix problems from the past and terminfo would not be in widespread use if AT T did not make vi 8 bit clean for SVr2 and at the same time converted it to use terminfo in a way that made a back conversion hard Sun did import this 8 bit clean vi fork from AT T in 1986 and this is the main reason why terminfo is in use today at all One of the useful results from heirloom is a 8 bit clean vi that is still termcap based so you can link it against a terminfo based termcap emulation library or a modern real termcap implementation like libxtermcap and compare guess what this proves Correct it starts up 30 faster when it is linked against libxtermcap and launched from a modern shell that caches a preparsed TERMCAP in it s exported environment Such a shell is e g the recent maintained Bourne Shell with the command line history editor based on the ved user interface Given that the TERMCAP caching technology was already available in 1980 I am not sure what purpose an incompatible terminfo could serve that could not be achieved by just introducing a new termcap entry name for enhanced cursor movement support But as mentioned before today the terminals that would need this feature are no longer in use BTW as a hint ved is even in the list of UNESCO software so you may need to learn how to use a search engine Come back once you are willing to have a fact based discussion,0
The problem here is that we need to take a wiki kind of world point of view while we can present the obvious indian point of view it is also important to note that dharmic religion has spread beyond the gates of india and that some have slowly grown into an identity of thier own Putting the hindu infobox here may seem alittle biased because there are many people of dharmic faith who may not identify with hinduism i even hate using that word considering the vastness of it all but its an umbrella within itself We simply cannot say that Buddhist Sri Lankans or Punjabi Sikhs can be branded under hinduism While it is obviously true that Dharmic religons have an incredible amount of cohesion between its followers like between hindus and buddhists in nepal that isnt a proper reason to include the hindu infobox or ANY infobox for that matter in this article,0

Citing the Collins patent Collins patent 5 659 477 August 19 1997 pictures statues ornaments fixtures etc all by prearranged programming to homeowner design by verbal or keyboard Different programs of different types can be implemented per name or number or different mixtures of each On line programs can be selected to create very many commodities right in the house Collins patent 5 764 518 June 9 1998 continuation of August 19 1997 s description Orders can simply as well be made on line by computer after a customer draws in three D CAD on a home PC a three dimensional picture of the object regardless of size and shape that is ordered Within the three dimensions of said 3 D drawing a customer can simply pick a color from a large menu in a paint program that will also tell the customer what substance the color represents By drawing the objects with the pen and filling in the different strata sections etc with the colors corresponding to the materials in the menu a customer can custom create his own objects products etc This is done by the computer noting the location of each pixel in the three D program and the material corresponding to the color and simply directing the F Units 10 to place a puzzle piece 20 22 or block as seen in FIG 13A of that material in the same place in the three D object it is building per the program Each pixel can be numbered per coordinate and as well that same number can be assigned to its corresponding puzzle piece This will make it possible to build small objects and machines pixel by pixel while keeping close track by mathematical means if desired among other uses of mathematical coordinating The computer can with programming with the help of this mathematical coordinating make decisions if customer desires as to the size most optimum of varied interlockable puzzle pieces 20 22 or blocks as seen in FIG 13A used in areas of the object where it would be better to use larger puzzle pieces 20 22 or blocks as seen in FIG 13A as opposed to many of the same type material puzzle pieces 20 22 or blocks as seen in FIG 13A in the smaller sizes greatly minimizing the number of puzzle pieces 20 22 or blocks as seen in FIG 13A to be cut and placed After the customer finishes the design the computer will send the program on line if desired to the puzzle cutting plant and upon receiving it the plant computer can decide what resolution of cutting and best type of cutting per type of material per size requested in the program and as well make decisions as to whether or not cutting thick puzzle pieces 20 22 is optimum or whether many thin puzzle pieces 20 22 stacked and glued together into one puzzle piece is optimum given the fact that lasers and other high resolution cutting methods only cut well and with that accuracy when cutting thin sheet material or can cut some materials thicker than others accurately etc Decisions as to the size of puzzle pieces 20 22 or blocks as seen in FIG 13A relative to the size of the F Unit 10 to carry them can be made by the computer It is clearly the case that the Collins patents and the working device presented to the examiner is far and away further along than Ardian Bowers who did not invent any of what he is doing Adrian Bower is involved with scientific misconduct by not crediting the Collins work because the Collins patent discusses the work being done in the home and discusses a device that does lay conductive traces and can place steel to a one micron resolution What you have with Adrian Bowers is the politics of open source That is all Can you tell me what new innovation Adrian Bower has brought to the table None Neither has Hod Lipson and Freitas and Merkle have made only generalized comments on the Collins patents while Freitas has infringed at NIAC using the book for cover This is clear There is already an article on Adrian Bower s work what is wrong with what was there already What you have added is superfluous with no new source as well The deletion was simply functional not meant to be personal I apologize if you were somehow affended but that is my vantage on the situation which seems obvious to me What is your take on the Collins patents comparatively Why do you think more is needed,0

Actually I don t believe that any unbiased individual would confuse the unsubstantiated and untested claims of a vigilant attorney general s complaint with what can reasonably be considered factual The AG s complaint will be addressed in the court system and a trial will determine the outcome You re assuming that the outcome is a foregone conclusion You re saying that Tiger was the leader in using rebates in the manner you claim everybody else does now Where was that reported By some blogger with no research How is that not an opinion It seems that every hack on here with an axe to grind wants to bully others into accepting their POV is actually a fact and anybody who disagrees must be a moron,1

Isn t that in itself interesting and notable Wikipedia Reliable sources doesn t apply to medieval primary sources No policy is violated It s subjective isn t it Again why not just modify that paragraph placing it in a broader context with third party modern sources Just because the claim isn t true doesn t mean it should be suppressed We just need additonal information from modern scholars Angus Donal Stewart is a perfect source imo for this task Last resort should be an RFC to settle this matter including every other issue spawned by the Franco Mongol alliance arrticle with a community consensus,0
Hearfourmewesique may I make a request I know this may be asking for much but it far easier for me to read and distinguish different posts by different editors if they are separated Adding your answers to each point by TelevisionFan inside his post make it much harder for me to sift through Yes I know some editors prefer your method but since you re asking me to mediate this would you mind putting your responses in a separate post You can refer to the individual point with a summarized title or just quote the passage by him that you re responding to as I sometimes do I apologize if this gives you more work to do but there s a lot of material to go through Also I m going to a family wake tomorrow and a funeral the day after that so there is a possibility that I won t be able to respond until Tuesday Hopefully we ll all be able to be patient until then Thanks Hearfourmewesique if you put your responses in separate posts as requested by Nightscream I have a request too Could you please quote from the Wikipedia references the sentence s contained in the references that I m accused of violating or would violate if my contributions are incorporated As I stated in this section earlier today I have read the Wikipedia references which you cite which include WP COPYVIO WP TROLL WP POINT and WP COMPETENCE but I am unable to determine where you are able to show support for your comments I am not asking for WP IDIDNOTHEARTHAT which seems not to apply in our dispute because you haven t shown 1 a rejection of my input by a consensus of the community and 2 my refusal of acknowledging your input Thanking you in advance Nightscream s Response THE FIRST SENTENCE The distinction between each versions of the sentence is minor at best and in my opinion I see little reason why this had to be such a point of contention It s the sort of thing each of you should ve been willing to compromise on But if you really need me to split hairs over this I would suggest that noting how soon before Pinochet s fall the emigration occurred may help readers familiar with Pinochet to get a more precise idea of when Fring s emigration was This may be even more relevant if Pinochet s fall is directly relevant to the plot line Is it However TelevisionFan says Ref 4 supports this As of this writing that source is the Dave Itzkoff New York Times article but I m guessing he meant the episode Hermanos since that was Ref 4 as of the writing of TelevisionFan s message here See this underscores the need for clarity in discussions like this naming the source would ve been more clear Hearfourmewesique I m not quite sure I understand your statement How does episodecite pertain here FIRST SENTENCE PARAPHRASE The fact that Pinochet s fall is not explicitly mentioned in the quote does not in itself mean that it cannot be mentioned since it s a real life event whose occurrence is documented You may not have to mention the fall but at the same time you don t have to omit it either It s a separate fact not specific to the issue of the paraphrase Again this is really major league hair splitting over such an irrelevant picayune detail one that both of you should be willing to let go of And what is the nature of the inter article inconsistency TelevisionFan Other Wikipedia articles may not be used as sources per WP CIRCULAR but merely quoting one is not a copyright violation since Wikipedia is free That s the entire point upon which Wikipedia was founded My question above about the relationship of episodecite to this matter also applies since I m not sure I m understanding how that plays into this It s helpful in instances like this to explain the context in which points of argument like that arose in the first place TONE If the exact number of years is known then yes giving it is perfectly reasonable However I think it s a gross overstatement of one s case to say that it violates WP TONE to say a few Where the exact number of years is not known a few is perfectly acceptable since it s a just a non specific small number or amount and not IMHO an informality THE NOTE I m not sure if for the purposes of this article there is a difference between not being able to trace someone and the non existence of records of someone but when in doubt or conflict I would just say what the source said When points of paraphrase are disputed one of my solutions is to simply replace the paraphrase with a direct quote It solves the conflict rather nicely Please consider doing this Television Fan Hearfourmewesique says that Gus is referred to as Grand Generalissimo by Hector Salamanca in the opening scene of One Minute Do you dispute this Again I think a mountain is being made out of a molehill with the focus on the September date of the assassination It s a minor detail It could ve been left out but leaving it in hardly harms the passage I think this is a matter upon which you should both compromise by just dropping the issue If they could not trace him then just say that they could not trace him Again just say what the episode said That way the conflict is bypassed There is no substantial distinction between the words connected aligned or involved This is another issue of hair splitting However as far as the question of confidence is concerned I think might be is different from likely Just use the word that was used in the sources The New York Times story that is cited in the article makes it fairly clear that there was some affiliation with the government The distinction between Pinochet and Pinochet government is yet another obsession over trivia In any event which usage do you prefer TelevisionFan The note says there are two instances which demonstrate his likely involvement in the Pinochet government Is this not right These are minor details but yeah the detail about the phone and the altercation can be omitted They re not that relevant to the information in question The fact that they re two different instances is indicated simply by the word later The distinction between who Gus really is and His knowledge of Gus past is hair splitting though the latter does sound a bit more encyclopedic I m afraid that my ignorance of the series makes me unable to evaluate the issue over the nature of Eladio s knowledge of Gus I ll discuss solutions to that below As to TelevisionFan s question Why are there two different descriptions of the same event in the same article my response would be to avoid repetition Much in the same way that we use synonyms in order to avoid using the same individual words over and over don t we vary multiple word passages for the same reason I hope I ve been some help If you two do not feel that my responses provide appropriate avenues for resolution and still want to drag this out I can open up an Request for Comment I can also try inviting others more familiar with Breaking Bad to join this discussion One request Please do not interlace your responses inside the other editor s messages This isn t a question of aesthetics or an attempt by me to be dictatorial I genuinely find it more difficult to sift through the thread to attribute the right message to the right editor Try doing what I have done here Give a title to the subtopic and then respond Or quote the statement that you re responding to Let me know what you wish to do,0
Users Beamathan and Dbachmann have set out to change the target of this redirect until now redirecting to Kosovo to Kosovo Republic of Kosovo thus leading to a tiny section of this article In my view this is just another POV disruption as this move pretends to alienate the republic from the region as if users searching for Republic of Kosovo were supposed to be searching for a small note on what would be an unimportant detail about Kosovo Not the case Every matter regarding the Republic of Kosovo is related to Kosovo itself like it or not therefore users searching for Republic of Kosovo should be redirected to the top of this article Furthermore I don t think there s ever been a consensus for this re targeting of the redirect Feedback is welcome,0

I explained my reasons for removing that part of the content and none of you have been able to repudiate it No one certainly not me is trying to harm the article on the contrary my assertion would improve it because it would then be more accurate and could not be accused of being POV with regards to the Onh suggestions As for the man typoing in caps I can well understand his frustration,0
Failing that the tables at Brazil national football team Competitive record seem more standardized across various articles I ll follow the method of the Scotland article Even though you re right that other articles have a different and more standard section I believe this might be one of the reasons the Scotland article is FA and the rest are not Aside from that I think that I nested the templates not really sure if it s right,0

On February 1 1991 former Nebraska State Senator John DeCamp filed a civil suit on behalf of Paul Bonacci The suit named Lawrence King the Catholic Archdiocese of Omaha the Omaha World Herald retired Omaha World Herald publisher Harold W Andersen the Omaha School District former Omaha Police Chief Robert Wadham and others The Bonacci suit alleged that King and the other named defendants had forced Bonacci to participate in a child prostitution ring that involved satanic rituals and orgies with other boys and girls Bonacci claimed that the defendants abused him sexually or were responsible for abusing him which caused him permanent harm Senior U S District Judge Warren Urbom of the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska in Omaha removed the diocese from the lawsuit ruling that the archdiocese could not be expected to know what individual priests had been doing in Boys Town and an appeal against the removal failed The other named defendants were cleared leaving only King to stand trial 13 At the time of the civil trial King was still in prison serving time for embezzlement He was served a court summons however he never responded to Bonacci s allegations Judge Urbom said There is no indication he King wanted to dispute this On February 4 1999 Judge Urbom awarded Bonacci a default judgment of 800 000 in compensatory damages and 200 000 in punitive damages The judge declined to consider the merits of the petitioner s allegations however he ruled that the failure of King s attorney to respond to the charges has made those allegations true as to him Urbom said he determined the amount of the damages based on Bonacci s allegations that King had sexually abused him and caused him permanent harm 14 13 15 16 An appeal of the default judgment was filed however it was dropped in January 2000 King was released from prison April 10 2001 17,0
Fixed the date As to quality it is now B class To get to GA the lead needs work and I was hoping to expand the Early life section with who his parents are remove it from the infobox as the relations spot is more for people with blue links and his first marriage kids Plus high school info too Otherwise we are missing 20 years of his life Plus then work in the new family info as well The other big problem is the Sex abuse section It is really bloated and a separate article should be spun off that repeats some of this but would also cover the related items that should be removed from here WW coverage info Guisto Kulengowski etc so that it is more manageable and less WP UNDUE and much more focused on what Neil did,0
Strong oppose The person who created this article apparently didn t realize that eventually every appointee on this article will resign and be placed in the Appointees who have resigned from the Trump administration article What we re effectively going to see is this article eventually disappear because all appointees will eventually resign and become former nominees and the other article becoming the main article It s more sustainable to keep this all in one article,0
Actually RR It was Geoffrey Burbidge who first noticed the periodicity of z 1 95 and throughout the years a small group of others also analyzed copious amounts data coming up with a list of prefered z values As discussed in Quasars Redshifts and Controversies the group is Burbidge and Burbidge 1967 Karlsson 1971 73 77 Barnothy and Barnothy 1976 Depaquit Pecker Vigier 1984 The list is as follows 0 30 0 60 0 96 1 41 1 96 It was identified by Arp that there are other periodicity groupings as well and that certains groups of quasars exhibit certain ranges of periodicity One more thing after spending most of the night re reading instead of sleeping I can add additional comments about Arp s books Arps first book Q R C focuses primarily on the observations with little emphasis at all on his variable mass theory It is the second book Seeing Red which gives more emphasis to the theory side along with an updated list of observations that where not included in the first book I recommend you start with the first it is written in a different style ie he seems much more focused on the observations and less upset at the standard community than in the second book,0

As can be seen most of the references are from pro Russian sites trying to show themselves as victims of the Estonian government In fact the situation is quite the opposite I live in Tallinn and tonight angry Russian speaking drunk youths and drug addicts literally devastated the city centre looting shops and drinking right on the streets They were not mourning they were glad and laughing Sorry for the offtopic however it seems that this article in its present form is not neutral but has a strong pro neo stalinist bias in certain points I call for balanced account of all events and removal of several links to which is a biased site look yourself and you can see that this is a campaign site This article is about the campaign to save the statue As well as the Estonian Governmets campaign to demolish it The statue itself is not spectacular maybe just worth an article but not the subject of international news,0
On reflection I m not sure that hastily is the correct phrase The original English version based on the proclamation was written in about 4 days The Maori version was written over night by two fluent Maori speakers and writers It was recently pointed out that Henry Williams was probably the most fluent Maori writer in NZ in 1840 as few Maori could write at all His son who helped with the translation was also very fluent The treaty is not very long at all so a few hours would easily be enough to do a translation Hastily suggests it was perhaps full of errors whereas most historians now recognize that Williams was deliberately using the sort of Maori language that was most frequently in written use the language of the bible to explain concepts that no Maori were familiar with Claudia Orange our most notable treaty historian says she is convinced Maori knew and understood what they were signing Later events showed some Maori wished to change their minds largely due to the fact that far more Europeans came to NZ than what they had imagined Maori complaints about the treaty itself are non existent even in the 1860s Their complaints were of a more specific nature,0

Let me help you out There is a relevant policy that you must not be aware of because you just violated it You have recommended to me to review the OWN policy which means that you believe that I think I own the article since I created it Now let me be clear it is against Wikipedia policy to claim that I am not working in good faith because I think I own the article Now you now have been made aware of that policy so let s put that to rest going forward I don t own the article any more than you do but of course in direct contravention to what you have claimed I have NEVER claimed that I do own the article So just stop it Period Your recommendation that I review COAT means that you believe that I am attempting to turn one of the articles into a coatrack So let s just get that one out of the way also Of course I am not attempting to create a coatrack I m just trying make the articles consistent with each other Either the traffic violations are relevant or they are not I am working on just one topic A coatrack is a series of things added to the article to hurt someone s reputation Once again I am just working on one topic So that red herring can be sent away I have made the point and I am doing it againbut having to jump through a bunch of distractionsthat the traffic records of Noem ALREADY is a campaign issue and Gould s traffic record is ALREADY a campaign issue Noem s tickets did not happen in the last year They are all old They are only coming up now because of the campaign The ticket are a campaign issuejust like Gould s traffic record is an issue I am just attempting to balance the article with relevant reliably sourced information Also if we decide and consensus must be reacheddon t revert me again without discussion as you have in the past that the traffic violations must remain then the violations need to be trimmed down Because as they are currently written there clearly undue weight given to them Also your statement that my trim down just doesn t cut it will not work If I was you I would tell you to review the Wikipedia policy about OWN but I am not going to do that What I am going to say is stop it You need to engage in real discussions with editors that you don t agree with and that is the way to reach concensus You need to engage in real discussion by stopping reverting me without comment and then slapping scary warning templates on my talk page It is truly annoying and it violates the general policy that you claim that I violate which is good faith The traffic tickets are a campaign issue for both Noem and Herseth Sandlin That is all the media has talked about in SD for the last two weeks So if we are going to put in Noem article long endless details about Noem s record then there will be campaign context added as well That is the point of this discussion We need to write a NPOV article that does not give undue weight to one aspect of a 38 year old woman s life You need to focus on the NPOV aspects of the topic and the undue weight issues and providing balance to the fact that the traffic tickets are only in the news because the election campaign and the other campaign has traffic record issues also So now the parameters have been laid out,0
I appreciate your comment Actually there are 3 positions being discussed One is to replace the original inkblots with different ones that would look very similar but when placed side by side are clearly different Under the image could be a note that would describe it accurately Non rorschach inkblot The other one is to hide it although this is more of a compromise than fruit of ordered discussion and consensus And the last is to show it The page of list of sexual positions had a similar problem and was resolved by replacing realistic photographs with drawings They contain less information but enough to convey the positions So there is one precedent for at least the first position I mentioned,0

I have just had to yet again fix this article s confused discussion of the controversy over Elba s casting I ve fixed it before but someone keeps changing it back to Elba s casting prompted a debate amongst comic book fans and a proposed boycott by the Council of Conservative Citizens some insisting it was wrong for a black man to play a Nordic god I m sorry but whatever the reason that someone prefers that wording it s not accurate and it doesn t make sense If you use it it suggests that it was the CCC who were having the debate with some of them thinking that Elba s casting was appropriate and some saying it was inappropriate which obviously isn t the case ALL of the CCC thought it was inappropriate the debate was among the fans,0

The interview video links are from news channels done out of character and are therefore reliable You can take a look at it for proof JR s blog as far as I understand has nothing to do with kayfabe because it is not linked with WWE com but it has more to do with his own opinions and as former Senior VP of talent in the WWE his opinion does count Otherwise I guess we should also remove points like considered one of the finest wrestlers from the pages of Sting Windham and others to keep Wikipedia consistent if we cannot post similar information on the Undertaker page despite having reliable sources Not sure why but I always get the feeling that the Undertaker page is highly constrained compared to other wrestler pages and a lot of information is prevented from being posted here which otherwise seems relevant by looking at other wrestlers pages At least can we mention some other descriptors which he has like the grim reaper more of a nickname in the early 1990s rather than a descriptor the best pure striker in the history of the game and the most dominant force in the history of the WWE etc for which we can also get links from WWE com,0

Before I revert you again I would like to point your attention to wiki link where it was previously debated The fact is that the German name is not used in English sources Charlemagne is not just a German national hero why not his Dutch name for one and the name is available on the German wiki link provided If Karl der Grosse were found in English language literature it would be relevant But it isn t If Charlemagne were especially known as a German national figure it may be relevant but he isn t to the English or anybody else but the Germans perhaps,0
Comment Support I suggest we move this page to M2 M3 Bradley or M2 M3 Bradley Fighting Vehicle rather than that suggested Technically the M2 is the Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle IFV and the M3 is the Bradley Cavalry Fighting Vehicle CFV To clarify the point I support the name change but to the name I suggested instead of simply Bradley Fighting Vehicles You wouldn t suggest moving say M16 rifle to M16 rifles to cover its subvariants,0

Indeed I did revert first I believe it needs to be clear that Manchester was the combination of two former universities as in the lead sentence It doesn t directly follow from institutions that it succeeded compared to UCL City Maybe this needs to be clearer I think it was in a previous version of the article,0
Further on we should know that theese parts are only a thiny little bit and barely is able too see in a map It is maybe 4 5 villages in Zavidovici and maybe 7 or 8 in Maglaj and the election commitea has included all theese into Zepce municipality so that theese villages are included in Zepce election Also we might seen in this map that Zepce actually are a little bigger now then before war why well now its obvious because parts of Maglaj and Zavidovici were added Thats why this Ceha map isnt proper for a reliable map here at Wikipedia since he has taken great parts of Maglaj municipality which in reality is untrue since only small villages were added and thoose villages were only a couple of kilometres away from the city Although I dont want to return to old map either since that is also untrue in that case about Mostar since Mostar is divided but not like that For example in East Mostar is included 1 Cvrsnica mountan to the border of Risovac and Posusje municipality 2 Diva Grabovica and Strizevo villages of Donja and Gornja Dreznica included 3 Velez and parts of Prenj mountain 4 Everything east of Bulevar street in the city section 5 Blagaj 6 Neretva river all the way from Blagaj to Jablanica included villages like Vrapcici Potoci Glogosnica Thats East Mostar correctly by the way that almost 100 of the citizens there are bosniaks and were part of East Mostar during and after war and the election entities are divided into east and west mostar Thats why the map before and now is uncorrect because of Mostar and because of Cehas map,0

There s currently a minor edit war going on over whether to include a see also link in this article to our article on Geronimo Take a look at these sources read them in their entirety before you decide and especially before you expunge mention of Geronimo from this article A longstanding tradition among members of Skull and Bones holds that Prescott S Bush father of President George Bush and grandfather of President George W Bush broke into the grave with some classmates during World War I and made off with the skull two bones a bridle and some stirrups all of which were put on display at the group s clubhouse in New Haven known as the Tomb source New York Times 19 Feb 2009 There s a Skull and Bones document that describes how Prescott Bush and other Bonesmen robbed the grave of Geronimo and I spoke with several Bonesmen who told me that inside the tomb there s a glass display case containing human remains and the Bonesmen have always called it Geronimo said Robbins author of Secrets of the Tomb a book that delves into secretive societies at Yale with special attention to Skull and Bones and its paths to power The robbing of Geronimo s remains fits into what Robbins calls crooking a competition among Bonesmen to steal valuable things which were then hidden in the tomb which has extremely limited access source CNN 25 Feb 2009 Geronimo became a celebrity in the twilight of his life appearing at fairs and selling souvenirs and photographs of himself He died of pneumonia in 1909 at Ft Sill and was buried at the Apache Indian Prisoner of War Cemetery on the military base Three members of the Skull and Bones including Prescott Bush served as Army volunteers at Fort Sill during World War I They are accused of stealing the items which supposedly are used in initiation ceremonies One alleged ritual includes kissing Geronimo s skull source Fox News 17 Feb 2009 Most other major news organizations have reported about these allegations also e g see Associated Press via MSNBC see NPR see this CNN video especially beginning at 1 45 min in the Yale Daily News also reported on it There s certainly doubt about the truth of these allegations but they re also certainly relevant to Prescott Bush and should be included in the article about him,0
I don t have too much problems with that I might add digging at the carpet and dislodging the newspaper that is there for their use as additional difficult behaviours but really we need to reference things I m reasonably up for a discussion on how to improve things if we three want to work together I have a couple of owners manuals whose intros might be relevant One mentions that ferret eye slits are horizontal so they re sensitive most to vertical movement which may explain the jumping up and down in the war dance I can t remember what it s called without digging it out The other is Ferrets for Dummies If we are going to make a team effort a place to start might be agreeing a general structure for the article As I said above the pets bit includes lots of extraneous material,0
A small point Nightscream to answer one of your queries and point at the larger problem with TF s approach You asked How does episodecite pertain here When you cite an episode you rely on the episode itself as the primary source TF however insists on clinging onto the text of the episode s article for example the verbatim quote because he knows who Gus really is from Hermanos Breaking Bad which both violates WP COPYVIO since you re quoting another Wikipedia editor without the proper attribution which is always needed even if it s free and demonstrates a lack of creativity for a good paraphrase rewrite which constitutes the very essence of encyclopedic writing I would really like to get it over with I have presented a professional neat and smoothly readable version,0

I can t see any reason why this has been removed from the lead section as noted above by Tony Sidaway these are all significant statements and assert a nation s importance in regional and global affairs I agree that this is encyclopaedia and of course there needs to be rules that govern the way things are done and there needs to be a degree of uniformity However all countries are different Pakistan wasn t the only country that featured foreign relations Admittedly a majority of featured articles do not have foreign relations in the lead section but so what does this mean now that all other articles that mention foreign relations should be purged Are moves being made to ensure that the other featured articles now conform to this uniformity All countries are different have different histories etc and consequently you cannot expect every article to confirm to exactly the same template or format There needs to be a degree of flexibility as long as the article confirms to NPOV and other core policies of wikipedia I cannot see the rational for this being removed GMT,0

As I already explained the issue is entirely around your third question The others are not contested Bloomberg is an RS and as such point 1 is fairly irrelevant Your fourth question hinges entirely upon the answer to the third right now The problem with number three is that your logic contains a pair of non sequiturs That means you state premises then derive conclusions that do not follow from those premises You are presuming that there is some influence over the operations of snopes that contributors to the crowdfunding campaign are capable of exerting I don t see any evidence of this yet it must be true for this statement to have any relevance Bardav s only operations are the operations of snopes com Therefore we have an entire article about Bardav We re on it s talk page right now The crowdfunding campaign was an exception to Bardav s normal revenue models which are accurately described elsewhere in that section Aside from taking issue with your characterization of the campaign as accidental this does not follow Simply because it happened does not make it due Simply because it happened as a direct result of a notable event does not make it due I have reverted your addition again I did not do so yesterday because I don t want to edit war However now that you ve given your reasoning I find it entirely unconvincing As such I don t believe this information belongs in the article We may continue to discuss this on this page if you like If additional editors engage and support your position or if you can present a better argument for the inclusion then of course at that point it can be re inserted,0

To 1 I have added fundamental Of course this increases the Cartesian feeling But that is not an argument against its inclusion For yes I have just lately removed all overt references to definitions of philosophy Please join me in being wary of the conflation between definitions with descriptions It makes all the difference to what we re talking about If somebody describes something in one way then another person may describe it in another and that s felicitous By contrast when someone provides a definition they stipulate the terms under which we are to exhaust the minimum of some subject at hand Descriptions are fungible definitions are ostensibly not at least for any given speaker Hence with 2b we have the supposedly analytic treatment in terms of higher order analysis which is entirely plausible and well received in the literature not just analytic literature but the literature as a whole But that does not exhaust the subject So we can and have described it in other terms too If you accept that philosophy is hard to talk about and you accept that we should be modest in our ambitions that is deal in terms of descriptions and not focus on definitions then you ll accept that no single description will be satisfying for anyone who is out to get a feeling for the whole field If you think there are Continental style descriptions that are being neglected that they are totally untreated by the current material and that they really and truly are examinations of what philosophy is and are not merely expressions of individual philosophical content then find a source and include them Higher order examination is NOT circuitous any more than talking about speech is identical to use of it It is perhaps tedious or spirallic Not circular I hope I have not misread your use of circuitous here Both myself and many others cannot agree to your stance against tertiary sources I can t make any sense of your Western critique Give the sentence another read Nothing like what you suggest is implied Tons of problems in philosophy has been solved if you ask any philosopher who is even mildly interesting Intros are meant to be informative esp in giving a picture of the article to come If you think the prose is Scooby Doo then add as many polysyllabic words as are needed I won t because I find that strategic obfuscation is a thing worthy of contempt Lucidish,0

The belligerents section is starting to go wild again Although wiki link participated in some zoint activities with wiki link I do not think it s appropriate to identify all of its leadership as part of the commanders and leaders of the war especially including intelligence Zuma and political Tambo Sisulu leadership amongst the military And Zuma was not even heading up DIS by the end of the war that followe din the 1980s Joice Mujuru was not at the same level of seniority in wiki link as her husband Tongogara or others not mentioned such as Tungamirai Also not sure geopolitical pic has come out as intended cannot see which are other nations friendly to the nationalist guerrillas not knowing what camel is as a colour or is it meant to be everyone except SA,0

Ananda Marga and ISKCON these two are may be a religious or social organisation or movent as per here and as per the name Krishna Conciouseness Organisatin itself respectively Arya Samaj is a reform movement or may be to some extend a sect within Hinduism Osho page have two dissambiguation In any of the both cases they may be a reform movements with in any religion But don t understand Where Ayyavazhi stand from knowing all these organisations And if you compare Ayyavazi with any of these movements or sects I may say that you are throughly mistaken Because these are based on Hindu or some other scriptures and may be secular but based on Hindu Structure ISKCON Based on Bhagavatham and Bagavad Gita Arya Samaj Vedas These two are movements or sects based on Hindu scriptures but may be different view on those from other Hindus Ananda Marga Probabily secular but this was a organisation Osho Rajneesh Chandra Mohan Jain a reformer These two are reform movements or organisations Ayyavazhi is not based on any other religions I was telling right from the beggining that they Ayyavazhi have seperate independent scriptures And these scriptures says that the origina vedas were destroyed at the beggining of Kali Yuga and the present day vedas are nothing but which are made by Kaliyan And also bythe incarnation of Vaikundar all prevoious Puranas Agamas Sastra etc have gone awry and Akilam was given as a alternative for that i e The Ayyavazhi s have seperate scriptures and they don t follow that of Hindus How do you compare Ayyavazhi with all the above religious movements or sects based on Hindu or other religious structures Also I can t understand why wiki users are not understanding this simple thing even though I repeate the same many times,0
wants to create biography lines for all the characters in these pages which I m fairly certain would cause a lot of unnecessary clutter for a lot of fancruft about one shot characters A better idea would probably be to make more pages for the fairly major teams that don t yet have pages such as Kido Dr Riddles and Ted Jeed and merge the rest of the information into Minor Zatch Bell characters however given that there are a lot of characters in the series and many of them play important roles I think it would make more clutter as well I suggested a straw poll to see what the consensus would be but I m unsure of exactly what the procedure is So I guess I ll begin by seeing if there s any desire to change the way the Zatch Bell pages are set up,0
One thing that is for certain is that Hugh Jackman played the part of Root as well as Angier This is most evident in the scene where the two characters talk to each other after Root auditions The camera never actually shows the two of their faces in the same shot instead a double is used to portray the backside of the character This is done very convincingly and I must congratulate Nolan for fooling me on this issue the first time I saw the film However when Angier s face is shown he is being played by Hugh Jackman and when Root s face is being shown he is also being played by Hugh Jackman,0
BTW as an aside to all editors if the Gummies have been or are planned to be discontinued it would be interesting to include information on the driving force behind the decision Was it a delayed response to the BBB complaint about the misleading advertising The high corn syrup content The lack of antioxidant effects The excessively high levels of beta carotene vitamin C vitamin E and or the low levels of other essential nutrients Poor sales The product has been on the market for quite a while and the company widely promoted it for use by children This is the kind of information that would be salient for an encyclopedia assuming that it ever gets addressed by a WP RS,0

In all fairness to Uber it is a fact that most Western historiography on the 1812 war is heavily distorted by a pro Napoleonic bias Western historiography of this war is heavily influenced by French 19th century historiography much of which is one sided in nature and which reduces the Russians to the status of shadows I am familiar with many basic texts on the 1812 Russian invasion so I know the popular themes that are circulating Much of it leaves me stunned in terms of its mispresentations of facts No doubt,0

Yes this is a good opportunity to discuss editing changes There have been a lot of complaints that the fact that the equations in the Problem description section describe spheres is not documented I think that these complaints are just excuses since it is obvious to me that they are the equations of spheres However to call the bluff of these people doing the complaining I have provided a reference along with explanation to show that they are the equations of spheres This explanation is shown below This explanation will aid the understanding of GPS so if you are a supporter of improving the GPS document making it more readable and understandable you will support including the explanation below as a part of the GPS document On the other hand if you want to degrade the GPS document make it less understandable you may oppose the inclusion of this explanatory material So let s find out who the good people are and who the enemies of Wikipedia are or otherwise explain your position,0

Except if I were to be WP BOLD Then you could revert and we could discuss it which I believe is a fairly standard practice But anyway that s not my intention My intention is to suggest new categories on this page which can then be discussed on this page before any changes to the article Re Synthesis what it actually says is Do not combine material from multiple sources to reach or imply a conclusion not explicitly stated by any of the sources If one reliable source says A and another reliable source says B do not join A and B together to imply a conclusion C that is not mentioned by either of the sources So if the consensus position is clearly and correctly summarised and a scientist clearly disagrees with that position where exactly is the synthesis,0

Homunculus your problem is you should read Wikipedia s rule more carefully e g WP NOT WP NOR WP VERIFY WP RS WP BLPSPSetc before editing and joining this discussion If you can t give us valid sources to support what you said then those are your WP ORs sure you don t believe that is your OR but without valid sources BTW what you announced paper books are not available in every library in the world e g at least I can find neither both of these two titles I ve checked at my local libraries so can t verify their contents BUT MOST IMPORTANT to your mentioned content we need valid source to support your assumption that Li doesn t gained citizenship of U S directly or explicitly to against those explicit contents Li became a U S citizen or Li a U S citizen which available in already founded reliable sources But what maybe in the books you cited above is They do not say that s not an evidence to against what the other valid reliable sources stated Sir they don t say so they said that isn t so these are two different expressions for the total different semantics The editing of wikipedia articles isn t based on our personal knowledges or POVs or experiences is based on the valid sources to support the content We shouldn t make any judgment by ourself about if how when what Wikipedia articles must not contain original research The term original research OR is used on Wikipedia to refer to material such as facts allegations and ideas for which no reliable published sources exist We should also avoid WP ORIGINALSYN Do not combine material from multiple sources to reach or imply a conclusion not explicitly stated by any of the sources If one reliable source says A and another reliable source says B do not join A and B together to imply a conclusion C that is not mentioned by either of the sources This would be a synthesis of published material to advance a new position which is original research 8 A and B therefore C is acceptable only if a reliable source has published the same argument in relation to the topic of the article and we should try to balance the different POVs from the different sources please don t undue weight your favorite sources with such as description like superior better correct WP WEIGHT Keep in mind that in determining proper weight we consider a viewpoint s prevalence in reliable sources not its prevalence among Wikipedia editors or the general public To the question about chinese and chinese nationality there are enough many overseas ethic Chinese without Chinese nationality e g Gary Locke Yingluck Shinawatra etc To your final suggestion I personal can accept the idea to remove any controversial undue weighted contents which can indicate about Li s nationality totally when editors can t find consensus,0

On a bit of a reflection and read over I think shortening the sections of criticism and response and moving the meat of them to Views on the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions Movement is a good idea There could be more written on the topic particularly from world governments although we should try and keep to notable opinions I also think we could create a page History of the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions Movement in which a lot of the campaigns currently listed by country could be listed chronologically Alternatively we could make History of the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions Movement in the United States and History of the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions Movement in the United Kingdom or Europe generally and that could help to trim down the reactions section considerably The long Supporters Academic section could be seriously truncated and some text moved to Academic boycott of Israel although it largely covers everything listed here already and is itself quite long The same holds for Supporters Business and Disinvestment from Israel although it could also be split into a new section on Government support since that s significantly different from business bodies such as pension funds disinvesting Then there s the matter of the Boycotts of Israel page which seems to be duplicating large parts of this page albeit with more history I m loathe to suggest moving content there however since it already seems to be pushing the limits of readable prose for a page and it s confusing what having two such similar pages achieves Perhaps some of its content could also get moved into the newly created pages since it would logically function best as a kind of umbrella page,0

I have read it and not found one iota of evidence to support your claims just plenty of evidence that you are confused over what a head of state is And BTW I am not trying to push any POV I am pointing out the facts You however have given no credible sources whatsoever to justify why Wikipedia should ignore the consensus views of prime ministers Gough Whitlam Paul Keating and John Howard every Australian governor general who has ever been appointed all Australian attorneys general all Australian government departments respected academics textbooks sourcebooks diplomatic references diplomatic usage etc etc etc Nor for that matter are Wikipedians queuing to agree with you In fact going by past talk pages they have been queuing to say categorically you are wrong What exactly is your evidence that your POV is right We are all waiting for some evidence to back up your highly questionable claims Fear IREANN,0

outdent I ve copyedited the article to try and catch all the remaining diacritics so I ll score that out as done I also came across one or two instances of links to disambiguation pages so fixed them too Finally I standardized every reference to Valdir Pereira so it look the same in every instance I was slightly confused by his nickname not being used in the photo caption and didn t realise it was a picture of Didi I ve left the italics as is except for the reference to Combinado del Pacifico It s complicated by the fact that as far as I can tell Copa Am rica is rarely italicized on Wikipedia Also re reading the GA review criteria I think it s unnecessary to nitpick over MoS issues That s a job for the FA reviewers Still in the long term I think you ll have to decide whether or not to italicize all the stadia tournaments etc which have Spanish names I ll start going through the references just now and also start listing any POV language I might not get finished tonight though it s a long article Regards,0
I m assuming that we all understand the numerous issues of the article I understand fully that Wikipedia has standards for the sources to be used in an article But this article is not written in good faith It is extremely biased because the sources it has decided to depend on are also biased This isn t an argument It s pretty obvious that most of the sources are either Relying on yellow journalism to fabricate a story that will receive views Outright lying as a result of their condemnation of gaming as a whole Are not practicing good journalism by refusing to research a topic thoroughly These sources are NOT following their standards for news and they should not be used in Wikipedia for this article Please consider this The general public will look here first They will not choose to investigate further They will not care They will only see gaming as some utterly hateful community Wikipedia has a massive influence on how the world thinks and putting this article up as a summary of this issue is completely against what Wikipedia stands for This article is not published in good faith and that is utterly obvious PUT A WARNING at the top of the article that explicitly warns about the lack of neutrality honesty or reliability of the article sources The reason I put the Know Your Memes article as the alternative is because they use many good sources and truthfully explain what is going on Please consider this change It s a small one but it will change everything and make it a respectable article,0
Any additional comments,0
Your paragraph needs to be cited Bruce as I ve said before Which shouldn t be too difficult I m not sure about benevolent dictator I think you ll struggle for that citaion and I set you a challenge it perhaps also should read symbol of revolution in Latin America and the third world There is also a need on this page to show the vast criticisms of Castro as a bourgoise nationalist by many groups on the international left which are numerous and will help dispell some of the misconceptions about Castro s affiliations such criticisms began in Cuba in the late 50 s when he was hated by the Communists What is certainly verifiable is that all mainstream international reports and newspapers describe Castro in the terms Bruce has laid out here and thus they should be represented in some form on the page,0

I will continue to revert as your edits are tenditious POV As you say hile a lot of Albanians can identify their religion about 20 30 percent are active You seem to be under the mistaken impression that one has to be practising to be counted as an adherent to the religion This is certianly not the case elsewhere and in re other religions and should not be applied willy nilly to the Balkans and Albanian because one user has the idiosyncratic idea that only practising members of the religion count It is entirely appropriate to note in the text that some large portion of the population is not practising it is not appropriate to merely delete reference to the population in the summary data As for your working with USAID who cares You are not a source and your belief re the CIA factbook is irrelevant None of the other data with respect to numbers of Muslims or Xians takes into account practising or not e g Turkey e g England only ostensible adherents in some vague sense This is merely a question of consistency Now if you have objective sourcing with respect to percent of population practising say survey data I would encourage you to add some text in the body re non practising population in the Balkans else leave your personal predilictions out of the article,0

No I m taking steps to revert the change in the page name There are two issues Your argument that music is a language draws on a rather elaborate use of the word language that I think might pass by most readers Strictly speaking it s correct but morse code and the symbols used in video games could be broadly characterised as language too if you want to stretch the point that far People talk of the grammar of film editing There was nothing ambiguous to the normal reader about the previous title In removing language from the title you have privileged the reading of language over the reading of music by making language the unmarked default form This is not a distinction that a NPOV publication should be making Furthermore by your logic the article on music reading should be subsumed into this one since music is a language in the same soup as linguistic text Now are you going to revert the change or do I have to bother learning how to do so,0

These arguments show two glaring misconceptions about thermodynamics One you claim that the compressed air requires work This is true it does require work to compress air This means that there is a compressor linked up to this tube compressing air and that the compressor is doing work on the air before it enters the vortex tube The tube itself exerts no work on the air Two you claim that because the hot pipe can be used to heat things and the cold pipe can be used to cool things there is heat transfer This is not heat transfer into or out of the system You seem to be mistaking heat with temperature Yes the temperature at the inlet and the two outlets is different but the overall heat of all the air in the control volume of the vortex tube remains constant This is the thermodynamic definition of heat transfer Also if the hot air were to heat another system that would be after it was out of the system of the vortex tube You can t consider effects of what the mass does once its out of the system or before it s in the system from your compressor argument to be heat transfer or work done while in the system,0
Merlin I fully agree with the two responses at OR N The experts at OR N have seen this issue exactly as I do suggesting that it s you who really does need to go back and carefully read the policies on WP SYNTHESIS and WP NOR And in your reponses there you are still missing the fundamental point You are correct that we can take a quote by scientist X asserting Y in context and have this article imply the same viz that scientist X is on record as saying Y That s not synthesis or OR agreed BUT in the context of this article s classification system the same quote now implies that X is on record as disagreeing with Z BUT there is no way that any quote in context can imply all of X has said Y but X has not said A B C or D This problem I believe is insoluble Now before responding please let me know if you can understand this somewhat subtle point about the synthesis Meanwhile if you want to work on a new classification scheme there is nothing at all to stop you BUT you should be doing this in user space not article space,0

Since when the sadr is a state And since when it is a state just like France or Germany to be presented like them in wikipedia sadr is non recognized by the UN nor by more than 3 4 of the states in the world This means the world does not believe you and you have to deal with this It has no sovereignty on the the territory that it claims and it is not present there The territory is largely under effective Moroccan administration It means to control an arid and unpopulated strip but is based in Tindouf in Algeria and not in this strip It goes there rarely and only for symbolic propaganda shoutings And even this it does under extremely limited conditions and pays it with severe slaps in the face from the UN because of the military moves It s population is devided One part live in Western Sahara under Moroccan administration like Moroccan citizenships have Moroccan passeports etc The other parts are refugees in the camps in Tindouf who don t have identity papeers that are recognized worldwide It has no currency no tel code no postage stamps nothing that can indicate the sovereignty of a state The flag does only show in few ambassies in the world but not in more than 80 of them sadr fits more with the descriptions of an exiled self proclamed governement And it is listed there If we would count all these sort of entities as existing states like the Netherlands or Canada the world would have 250 states What I mean with going forward with this is that I don t want to discuss this fiction eternally The presentation of the article is wrong and I created an alternative for a compromise It shows all aspects of the sadr flag etc that can be further discussed but without presenting it like France Italy or Spain I have moved per redirect the page to a new one Hope this is ok so Thanks,0

Find me a source that says the photograph on the book cover is upside down or anything else you just said There are seven or eight editions of the book and out of all of them you seem to be suggesting that you want to use precisely this one because you think it s more notable than the others In what does anything you just said make it more notable than the first edition I don t see how you can explain this without implying a defamatory intent As for your comments about me only writing on subjects related to the author of this book I have contributed to various articles dealing with the Dead Sea Scrolls mentioning not only this author but other authors as well such as Magen Peleg Hirschfeld Elior and Bar Nathan I have contributed to the Schniedewind article as well with information concerning him that has nothing whatsoever to do with Golb Virtually anything dealing with the Dead Sea Scrolls will be related to Golb so this argument of yours is not convincing I have not maligned anyone or distorted the current state of research in this field and I will resist attempts of others to do so to further an agenda based on their personal opinions about who is right My aim all along has been neutrality and what is happening here with this photo is a perfect example of how personal opinions end up producing articles that violate neutrality,0

Poison That seems a bit extreme The article as it stands now is basically a list of talking points and counter arguments Take a look at the article history as you have advised others to do and I think you ll find that no matter how many rewrites there have been it always ends up as a list of talking points and counter points As fas as understanding my position we would have to define Socialism in a satisfactory manner for starters Your definition likely has little to do w mine I use this one and would simplify to say that it is a society other than laisse fair capitalism Thats huge and general which is the only way you can include soc dems and commies in the same word The terms used to discuss politics are terrible to begin with and thats really the source of all this trouble but we have to do what we can w what we have original research not being allowed I like alternate political spectrums like the Nolan chart myself,0

Please review MOS FILM and related policies and guidelines Also if you could point me to a critical reception section in either a FA or GA article that quotes the director I would be happy to look at it but I am not aware of any Critical reception does not usually mean that the director gets to reply to it Since the religious angle will keep coming up it looks like another section will have to be created since you find it necessary to include the opinion of the director in the wrong section I have no objection to including the quote in a section about religion but since it has yet to be written I removed it In another issue you restored IMDb as an inline source outside the infobox which is generally not best practice IMDb is rarely used as a source for content The material you added using IMDb is generally considered a primary source interpretation I realize that you think this material is important to include but we generally cite secondary sources to avoid editors determining what is important and what is not I think it is certainly reasonable to talk about the release history but you risk falling down a slippery slope when you interpret IMDb In this particular instance it s not really a big deal because it can be fixed easily but it s wise to keep an eye on how we use sources I ve addressed this in a separate section here,0

Additionally Wikipedia clearly states Wikipedia articles should be based on reliable published secondary sources and to a lesser extent on tertiary sources Meaning you need to have multiple sources to back up your argument Not doing so constitutes original research and that violates neutrality within an article Just because one or two reliable sources say Chicago there are hundreds that will contradict that statement and say Rosemont This is not some English paper your are trying to fluff up It doesn t matter if Chicago is more recognizable then Rosemont at the end of the day the arena will still be in Rosemont,0
We should remove the Iranic Iranian groups classification Reasons for this are the following Other articles about nations people don t state ethnic category Why Simply because no one knows if they re related or no such term exists for ethnic groups The term that exists is for the languages it s linguistic You could say that Kurds are linguistically Iranic but not ethnically however The classification on Wikipedia has changed with time while geting criticized from Iranian to Iranic to ethno linguistically Iranian etc etc Appearently this is just POV Also everyone who edits to the benefit of the Iranic classification have got some connections with Persians Iranians It s obvious they get angry when the Kurds are considered an independent people Many sources in this article even claim that the Kurds are an indogenous people that were aryanized Some people tend to bring these sources up several times These sources actually claim that the Kurds have nothing cultural ethnical with Persians Iranians to do Instead the two people Kurds and Persians are related linguistically like Italians and Kurds like Frenchmen and Persians like Indian and Kurds etc but they have very little in common culturally only Newroz,0
Where possible Chinese government sources should be corroborated with another RS There is a lot of propaganda emanating from the state obviously as many academics have noted The issue I take here is that in the very least state media presentations of materials pre persecution is more or less acceptable and not everything the Chinese gov t publishes on this matter is automatically sinister or part of a well organized conspiracy especially prior to 1999 one pet issue in this regard is the alleged link between Luo Gan and He Zuoxiu which remains in the main article for no good reason Much of the propaganda following 1999 is essentially embellished versions of pre 1999 investigative reporting Like the article notes many of Li s rival groups did the first exposes of Li and Falun Gong in general The point is Li s detractors were numerous and far reaching prior to the state s propaganda campaign This inevitably exposes another issue with the content which is that a dichotomy style presentation of Li s biography is highly misleading Penny discusses this in great detail I do not have the passages in front of me nor the time to flip through the pages again,0

Book of later Han fragments the the people by kingdom and during that time Korea was not united I don t see what your trying to prove Wang Man naming of Koguryo as Ha low guryo is merely Sino centric self satifaction Man enlisted Goguryeo forces to engage the Hsienpei 12 AD Goguryeo had a change of heart and warred with the Chinese armies instead Aahaha you claim to be historian yet you don t even understand the concept of terminological degradtion in chinese texts Wang yeo what the hell is that My god the Go house consolidated power during the reign of Taejo of Goguryeo Power was exchanged from the Hae Sono to the Go Kyeru It is the Go house that conquered its neigbors subjugated the Malgals created the stele and warred with China It has absolutely nothing to do with your overly thought out and quite laughable useless naming theory which either way doesn t prove jacksquat If your still unsure of about the usage and history of the name s of Goguryeo feel free to ask,0

Yesh Din is an Israeli human rights group providing legal assistance to citizens of the Palestinian territories organized to oppose the continuing violation of Palestinian human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory Yesh Din is comprised of volunteers who have organized to oppose the continuing violation of Palestinian human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory They look pro Palestinian to me but that wording could be improved It should be explained that they are a human rights organization with a focus that impacts their assessment of the subject of this article Why would we not clarify it anyways Clarity is a minor issue but not making it clear who the group is raises a neutrality issue in the article An easy fix might be simply stating a group focused on human rights in the Palestinian territories Why revert when it can be fixed with little hassle Any other suggestions,0
The source you refer to is an article in Canadian Geographic which is published by the Royal Canadian Geographic Society It is not an expression of official policy of the Society and you need to stop representing it as if it is All the sources you provided are specifically concerned with how the two lakes can be dealt hydrologically and are not statements that there is one lake and not two Your continued miscitation of what these sources says is starting to verge on intellectual dishonesty Please stop,0

Sorry if I was a bit snippy with you there but this situation has left me incredibly frustrated If you know who is in ARS then surely you should understand there was a clear conflict of interest on their part in not wanting the deletion discussion to be open more than a few hours Given that most of them didn t even give a policy based reason just makes it even worse Also WP NAC lists criteria for appropriate closures and this would not qualify It wasn t a full listing period and there was clearly contentious debate among the participants,0
Well I m clearly biased but It looks to me as if the problem is lack of citations not notability per se From Wikipedia Notability people notability depends only on citations has received significant coverage in reliable secondary sources that are independent of the subject In particular the first item in the list of what qualifies as notable is 1 The person has received a well known and significant award or honor or has been nominated for one several times Given that as pointed out above this seems to be satisfied is there any further reason to question notability,0

Hi 2005 thanks for your comments Let s take one topic at a time The first point I d like to discuss is this text According to Poker Listings in spite of his success Moneymaker is considered by some to be a one hit wonder WP BLP says that Criticism and praise of the subject should be represented if it is relevant to the subject s notability and can be sourced to reliable secondary sources and so long as the material is written in a manner that does not overwhelm the article or appear to take sides it needs to be presented responsibly conservatively and in a neutral encyclopedic tone So criticism is permitted in a BLP If your only objection is the phrase considered by some than let s edit the sentence to fix that or provide a direct quote from the reliable secondary source Which would you prefer Moneymaker has been the subject of criticism and it is acknowledged in reliable secondary sources Surely you are not trying to keep all criticism of MoneyMaker out of the article are you,0

I think it is a matter of neutrality per WP POV The quote and source is attributed to the US Army so it is the US Army saying or thinks that Gangnam supports the US Army which is different from Gangnam Korean or anyone else thinks that Gangnam supports the US Army A bit like a primary source asserting its opinion rather than neutral third party sources stating a widely known point of view Just because 150 or so events including high profile ones such as G 20 and nuclear summit were held within the district it doesn t mean there are support per say It is just a matter of location and businesses bringing revenue to the area So stating that Gangnam support them on the basis that these events were held there is stretching it a bit There needs to be third party sources to support such a statement and if YvelinesFrance is right re protests against the military then there will also be others that states the contrary,0

I think the first thing that needs to be done is for us all to recognise the difference between describing what somebody thinks and advocating or endorsing what they think Then we can look for places in the article where Zizioulas thought is endorsed rather than just described But as far as I can tell the article in its present form is appropriately wiki link I am disappointed that you avoid apologising for or even retracting your earlier personal attack on me in which you say If you are by any chance real seminarist of some Orthodox Seminary I can only be sorry for those faithful Orthodox people who would in some future be exposed to the clergy like yourself This comment is disgraceful and you had no right to make it It is a shame that whilst you trumpet so loudly what it is to be a traditional Orthodox Christian yet you do not behave like an Orthodox Christian,0
Also regarding truth see WP TRUTH Frankly we can only know what the reliable sources say If someone wants something true to be added which differs from what the reliable sources say then the best thing for them to do would be to try to get some other RS to say that And regarding the RSN they aren t infallible although they are very good in general But particularly when dealing with rather obscure sources they haven t encountered before on a subject they don t know they are as fallible as anyone else Regarding Jesse Lackman s comments in general I tend to agree with the one proviso that it can sometimes be hard to tell what is opinion when the number of reliable sources and sources in general is as scant as it is here By saying this I am not necessarily criticizing or disagreeing with him or anyone else just noting that there this is a very difficult subject to find a consensus of reliably sourced statements or conclusions regarding in large part because there is so little information available in the first place,0

Make up your mind either minority views as well as majority need to be expressed to prevent marginalization or generally accepted scholarship should be reflected in the article Either one of those results in rescue opera being included so it doesn t really matter which one you pick but the Grove view is so oppressed that it trumps the body of scholarship that contradicts it is nonsensical,0

In addition this more recent source explains why her mother was confident that she passed away on July 3 She was found in bed apparently and had plans with the family the next day Although July 3 is very likely the correct date based on these facts it s still not official e g there are other possible explanations for a July 4th or July 5th date The obituary gets us closer and we can likely use it if there s never an update released from the coroner s report but we should probably hold out a bit longer IMO,0

Hi I have created around 14 000 articles on wikipedia higher than anybody and am currently adding Frebnch communes at bot speed around 6 a minute and have requested that my new articles are automatically filtered but noone seems to be concerned I have addressed this to several people but no one has taken it seriously when I said I was concerned about clogging up new pages even when I am adding general content I refused adminship long ago but surely I am respected enough to be regarded as admin level in editing I always add valuable content and most of my articles are referenced except such stubs Isn t it time somebody made a decision to help new page patrollers by helping them I ve contributed tens times more than many adminstrators on wikipedia 107 000 edits who automatically have their page unmarked shouldn t mine be the same on a permanent basis I consistenly add new content to wikipedia which is generally referenced and useful content wiki link is what I am capable of It would help patollers a lot Any idea if you can help me receive permanent clearance,0
You aren t making a terribly compelling argument Your first sentence makes absolutely no sense whatsoever Civil marriage which is the only kind we are talking about is not an institution that predates legislation but even if it were that would be irrelevant Legislation need not predate a thing to control it Also for the most part jurisdictions can t prohibit anything beyond their borders but it would be idiotic to claim that means a state can t prohibit something By your logic state prohibitions between certain degrees of consanguinity aren t actually prohibitions What the hell are they then Suggestions You obviously think you are coming from somewhere brilliant but you are either doing a particularly shitty job of communicating that brilliance or you don t know what you are talking about As for California it very much depends upon context California needn t by fully explained in the body text every time the ban issue comes up,1
We have a reliable source that says it which means the statement can stay whether or not individual groups have it listed in the official procedures Period The reliable source verifies it and that is all that is necessary for inclusion Besides that the source says that it s unusual not that it doesn t happen If it doesn t happen the source would have said This doesn t happen anymore though Stop with your original research It s not an urban legend as is shown by the source many conversion websites and individual testimony so stop acting like anyone who believes that it is true is gullible and falling for something that YOU have decided is an urban legend It has happened it is happening and it will happen Even if it s not happening to every single convert or isn t listed under official procedures that doesn t mean it s an urban legend Unless you can find a reliable source that actually says it is an urban legend all this babble is original research which has no place in any Wikipedia article If you keep fighting this I will take it to higher powers,0

This discussion relates to this edit A version of this text was posted by me as part of a greeting message at There are really two reasons for my edit though I only mentioned one in my necessarily brief edit summary Firstly as far as I m aware Knowyourmeme com doesn t qualify as a reliable source for our purposes To be sure it s an award winning and popular website like Wikipedia But also like Wikipedia it can t be assumed to have the reputation for editorial fact checking we expect of a reliable source as far as I know Second no matter how reliable a source is single sources will inevitably have their own bias We aim to counteract this factor by balancing the statements of multiple reliable sources We would not recommend one single source as authoritative as your edit seems to propose My reverting your edit should not be seen as the end of the matter It s certainly conceivable that I m wrong and that Know your meme is a reliable source and then at the very least we could use it to help improve our article,0

The recent edit by Hedley reworded the paragraph about etymology from the Northumbrian Gaelic origin mentioned as secondary by a previous anonymous editor after the Romany origin to stating Northumbrian Gaelic as more or less the most likely theory I m still a bit bothered about it being mentioned at all simply because all evidence I found last time I thought about it pointed against it and towards Romany Someone and I m particularly addressing Hedley who seems eager to put it in the spotlight might be able to point to some kind of source It s also not specified whether we re talking about an English accent or an actual Celtic language I m betting on the former but this would sort itself out if we see some sources Worth pointing out is that these two ideas Northumbrian Gaelic versus Romany are not opposites It might have been borrowed into Standard English from Northumbrian Gaelic but ultimately of Romany origin 5 July 2005 18 39 UTC,0

Trivia,0
Losses from the official returns taken the day after the battle Household Brigade numbering 1 319 page 217 Adkin Mark The Waterloo Companion London 2001 killed 95 wounded 248 missing 250 totals 593 horses lost 672 Union Brigade numbering 1 332 page 217 Adkin Mark The Waterloo Companion London 2001 killed 264 wounded 310 missing 38 totals 612 horses lost 631 Losses from page 544 Smith Digby The Greenhill Napoleonic Wars Data Book London 1998 That the Union Brigade fielded far fewer then their official numbers is based solely on a comment by Capt Clark Kennedy of the Royals in one of his letters to Siborne this was expressed as an opinion and was not backed up by any alternative authority That the brigade should be down over 300 men after a not very arduous campaign up to that point seems unlikely as the horses had not suffered any appreciable strain and were in an areas where plenty of fodder was available and the climate was no different to their native one Some men such as farriers and surgeons would have been left in the rear but such men would have numbered a couple of dozen at most It seems incredible that a brigade should have 250 men sick or injured or with sick or injured horses appearing on their rosters It can be seen from the figures quoted above that the Union Brigade could not have lost two thirds of its numbers killed and wounded in its first charge because it lost slightly under half its numbers as casualties for the whole battle Even if you believe Clark Kennedy s estimate that fewer than a thousand men were in the Union Brigade s ranks at the start of the battle the estimate of two thirds killed and wounded in the first charge still doesn t make sense because it would mean that the brigade could have experienced no losses at all during the subsequent hours of the battle A number of eyewitnesses state clearly that the Union Brigade experienced considerable further losses later in the battle to artillery fire especially but also infantry musketry and in the Greys case cavalry carbine fire,0

Your argument that All controversial images should not be hidden or all of them will presents a false dichotomy Because each one can be discussed independently What you propose is a wide inderpretation of the censoring policy that leads to contradictions As we can see in the text of the policy itself that reads some articles may include objectionable text images or links if they are relevant to the content and do not violate any of our existing policies A wide interpretation would mean that relevant information will be CENSORED if it violates existing policies We also have the policy of Wikipedia is not censored and honoring the title of its article page What the wikipedia is not there are several policies that say what should NOT be in the wikipedia Or using the same wide interpretation what should be CENSORED So this latter policies would be in direct contradiccion with the censoring policy A second interpretation that is not contradictory is that there should not be an expectation of censoring by the wikipedia or any other entity So if someone was to look for some authority that would censor a particular article they could come to this page and find this policy that reads The wikipedia is not censored Furthermore the policy also explains that such censoring cannot be done because of nature of the wikipedia and mentions how consensus is done by discussion open to anyone interested in a given subject Also on the same page there is a policy that reads Wikipedia is not a bureaucracy saying that we should Follow the spirit not the letter of any rules policies and guidelines and that Disagreements should be resolved through consensus based discussion rather than through tightly sticking to rules and procedures,0

Famousdog and Mallexicon On Wikipedia unlike Believerpedia or Skeptopedia we don t summarize only one side or aspect of a source s conclusions Ahn is specific about what suggestive means some of the studies albeit of low quality showed positive association between acupoints meridians and impedance etc and suggestive refers to those associations Ahn also says that these suggestive results can guide research that scientists may do in the future a statement that is of course true in any field These are specific antecedents of specific hardly throwaway Research into acupuncture is way more active than e g homeopathy because there are all sorts of findings that while not conclusive are suggestive enough to justify further research The article should make this clear which is easy enough when sources are summarized adequately,0

Before taking MPants at work s questions let me briefly introduce myself I recently translated the entire pages of Snopes com PolitiFact and fact checking from English to Japanese because fact checking organizations are relatively new to most of Japanese readers probably so as to other non American readers During the translation process I carefully read many of references of the three pages in order to understand the competitive landscape as well as different points of view Apologize in advance if I made make my English not so clear due to my poor second language skills Re crowd funding there are four central questions Is it true that Snopes raised money through GoFundMe If true which reliable source s tell so Is it worth to mention the fund raising activity on Wikipedia Finally does my edit comply with Wikipedia s policy etc My answers are Yes Snopes met the original half mil goal The Bloomberg s article citing originally from AP looks reliable to me But adding more than one references would be beneficial to Wikipedia readers FYI Bloomberg says Fact checking website Snopes com has quickly met a 500 000 goal set for an online fundraiser amid a legal battle with an outside vendor that Snopes says is holding it hostage Snopes started the GoFundMe campaign Monday and reached the half million dollar goal about 24 hours later I also found another report from Poynter saying Snopes is requesting readers donate 10 or more either through GoFundMe com or other means According to Snopes GoFundMe page 845 people raised more than 20 000 of the 500 000 fundraising goal in just three hours as of publication However I hesitated to cite the Polyster s report in order to avoid a potential conflict of interest PolitiFact is operated by Tampa Bay Times which is owned by Polyster Yes Sometimes any media organizations are easily influenced by their stakeholders including shareholders advertisers vendors and customers Bardav Inc operates Snopes and at this moment the Wikipedia article has almost nothing about Bardav as a corporate entity Thus many readers are probably curious how Bardav financially runs As far as I know most of other fact checking organizations are NPOs or under the umbrella of large media corporations Among them raising money from subscribers Snopesters is a different business model It accidentally happened as a result of the legal dispute between Bardav and Proper Media Therefore mentioning the crowd funding activity under the History section and right after the sentences of the law suit is appropriate I would like to wait for other Wikipedia editors feedback on this matter,0

I m not going to pretend that this is a simple issue and that you are looking at it all wrong but let my try to explain why things are organized this way We aren t obligated to simplify the history of Taiwan or the Republic of China into a coherent singular thread The fact is the the Republic of China didn t just shift its territory a little They lost all of the territory they used to control and moved to a territory they weren t previously controlling That s an oversimplifcation but you get the point They made a whole new government in a new place ruling over a new population with a similar but different culture that s also an oversimplification since that new government had a lot of structural continuity with the old one include the name The point is that since both the current PRC and the ROC commonly known as Taiwan have logical and rightful claims to ROC 1912 1949 as their immediate historical precedent it s important to have a separate article for reasons of neutrality in addition to the above mentioned distinctions This is all more complicated than people writing an encyclopedia would like but it s all explained in great detail in the body of the articles Furthermore the name Taiwan was chosen for the article about the current ROC because that is the common name You say it s just the common name but that is the standard used on Wikipedia for article names see WP COMMON The matter of what to name that article was discussed at length and a consensus eventually emerged that the article should be called Taiwan because that is the common name for the topic but further discussion of the name of that article should happen at Talk Taiwan or not at all Finally I would like to add that it s okay to have some discussion covering the same topic in more than one place It s not a problem if Taiwan and this article both discuss the same historical events,0

Hi Plumcouch Maybe you don t care whether the movie is a remake or an adaptation but readers worldwide who refer Wikipedia as a knowledgable and reliable source do There is a lot of difference between their meanings as much as between make and break Sanjay Gupta s work cannot be compared and referred to Nikhil Advani s work as they are both different individuals and so has been their work The contribution of the Editor who included SEI s pic is as much valued and appreciated as your contribution of the L NTFL picture However the latest pic stands more relevance to the readers vis a vis present times irrespective of the Star s looks which have only gotten better with the passage of Time Thanks Best Wishes Slytime,0
Well given that few of the other football clubs in Northern Ireland have translations to their name it makes no sense for Derry City FC to have the translation Obviously the page is locked so no change can be made anyway,0
Sounds very reasonable I agree,0
I realize this has been discussed before and I am not disagreeing with any of the ideas put forth above Rather it appears that we have a false consensus on what this topic should be i e many editors worked hard to craft a fine page but the page does not take into account that there are other legitimate views of the topic It appears to me that nobody would dispute that there was an occupation and that this occupation was disputed by at least some continuous group of resistance but at some point we have to account for the fact that the occupation was a flat out conquest in which the states in question become an integral part of the Soviet Union If the Soviet Union had not collapsed these states would not be independent Fast forward to the modern Wikipedia and this article looks to be little more than a part of the contemporary national rivalries between Baltic states and Russia rather than a balanced view of historical reality The Baltic states are right to view the period within the Soviet Union as an occupation but the Russians are right to view the same period as something else in this case a Soviet Union Let me also be clear that I am not fully backing Dojarca s position on this either He and I have had a fair amount of head butting elsewhere and do not see eye to eye on many things However I do agree with his over arching opinion that there is more balance which can be introduced into this article,0
Of course it s a reputable publication The source you cite shows that very clearly It s published by the Scottish Herald a major newspaper NOT by one guy is supported by a major university and has the normal editorial process that one would expect of a reliable source I think your reaction to it shows rather clearly that your view of what constitutes a reliable source depends on what POV that source presents,0
I just restored this but Franamax s post was not here when I was reviewing this thread I ve just seen it as I returned to note the restoration I m sort of split in my thoughts on the matter as I can see it from both points of view I hold no opinion on this specific piece of information at this time so if it is found necessary to remove the info again while discussion continues I m fine with that,0

So are you intending these to be real articles or not Also I m not sure what part of WP BIO guidelines you think they might meet We do have articles on models sometimes but they ve generally the well known ones If all we can say is that someone is a briefcase model they would be at best a one sentence mention in some larger article,0
First please sign your posts If this is a discussion page it helps to know who we re talking with I would agree with that the media we re exposed to is inherently biased against Saddam Hussein although even without that bias the man was a brutal monster The only positive thing I can imagine being credited to Saddam was holding control of Iraq albeit with an iron fist You re of course welcome to add anything you d like to this article as are all people and if your changes are accurate and reference good sources they ll stay I have to admit I think you ll have a hard time finding any You might look for quotes from Rumsfeld during the 1980s though,0

If you say like this why don t you use Tsushima province as a random reference instead Also if the people are not interested in Tsushima Islands but rather the other articles they have to take one step more and click on the piped Tsushima disambiguation and go to the second generation piped variants of articles with Tsushima and this is merely creating more unnecessary trouble for our valued readers For what should we compare with other encyclopedias on their naming conventions We are not interested to hoods what Britannica or other sources like to call their article And also britannica has no such disambiguation stuff unlike wikipedia And you must be sensitive enough to know that the structural conditions on other encyclpoedias is not the same as wikipedia,0

In the WikiProject Wikipedia Nuttall Encyclopedia topics we hit on the city Tirnova Tirnova is a fortified town of Bulgaria 35 m SSE of Sistova It is the seat of the Bulgarian patriarch It was formerly the State capital Sistova seems to be a town in Moldavia like the webpage of Tirnova The source is from 1907 so much has changed Thanks,0
The entire argument was rather thin as well since the Danish Constitution does not refer to the United Nations at all so unconstitutional hmm no,0

Please be more specific as to your accusations against me As my accuser you should not leave such charges to my imagination I should not have to guess what you have in mind In addiotion you should stick to the topic and not refer to other articles Let other issues be discussed elsewhere not here Things are already complicated by there being many articles grouped here for deletion You are apparently a very experienced Wikipedian It seems that you believe that I ve used vulgarities However you have not kept the principles of Good Faith in that accusation You are talking about conduct in a totally different space namely wiki link If that is your opinion please feel free to bring it up there but not here You are apparently merely attempting to portray my conduct once again as bizarre I do not deny you that opportunity However you must not do that here The topic here is already far to complicated you already forcing me to defend several articles that you believe should be deleted It is not good for Wikipedia for you to bring in my alleged use of improper vulgarities elsewhere I therefore ask you to cleanup from here all references to what I have done regarding a totally unrelated article Cheers,0
If you disagree with one of them you ll have to say which one They all look accurate to me,0
My edit summary Article title recapitulation in bold in 1st three words adjacent sufficient to establish subject of Infobox image And you can add a special explanatory note at the very end of the 1st sentence Grand Central Terminal is often incorrectly referred to as Grand Central Station the name of the adjacent block square U S Post Office station located immediately northeast of GCT at 450 Lexington Avenue 3 In railroading a terminal such as GCT is a passenger and or freight facility at the end of a rail line which trains enter from and depart in the same direction whereas a railroad station such as Pennsylvania Station is an intermediate facility along a rail line which trains enter stop and depart in opposite directions 4 Your edit summary Undid revision 651485595 by Wikiuser100 talk The title is also in the infobox in all other articles about MNRR stations Does it need to be Metro North Railroad Yours,0
By definition these attacks are the result of a conspiracy Who the conspirators are what their exact methods and goals were is still unproven beyond a reasonable doubt Many people believe the official story Many find that the official story has inconsistencies and inaccuracies which they would like investigated Belief is not proof In fact belief by a large majority of people in something which they have no direct knowledge is a very poor indicator that their belief is based in fact The percentage of people believing any particular chain of events involved is thus irrelevant The numbers quoted without reference are unless whole manufactured the result of polls conducted using questions and selection methods unknown to us and thus are immediately suspect Any fool can quote numbersand usually does The last numbers I saw indicated that only about 40 of US citizens believed the official story But 5 40 or 95 the fact that there remain questions in a great many people s minds is indicative that there is perhaps more to the story than the official word states There are basically two major conspiracy theories involved in this series of events 1 The official version states that the attacks are the result of the planning and actions taken by an Arab terrorist group 2 States that there are a large number of events which cannot be explained by this theory but can be explained by postulating a group of,0
It doesn t list other elements it lists THE elements it draws from If WALMART thinks it draws from Christian Rock why did they not list that as one of the elements Why are you still arguing about this Everyone but you have reached a consensus I guess you have a problem with what we decided though right Imagine that,0
Given the scope of the actions taken by this organization that are described in this article I think we really need to examine the statement that this focus of this group is Marine Conservation Most of the actions described in this article seem to be the actions of pirates and or terrorists not actions taken by a conservation group Given that this group now has a television series I m left wondering if the focus of this group isnt really profiteering Could we consider changing the stated focus of this group from Marine Conservation to something else as marine conservation does not involve the destruction of property the violation of Maritime Law throwing toxic caustic compounds into the sea or sinking scuttling ships I m left wondering how much damage to the marine environment they ve caused with each ship that they ve scuttled as described in this article Perhaps at the very least their focus should be changed to debated,0

The Battle of Puketakauere section has several long paragraphs that are entirely lacking in citations In fact just two paragraphs one of them very short lacked citations The descriptions of the battle are both drawn from the same sources both cited repeatedly through that section of the article so there is no need to pepper the paragraphs with identical citations when there is little likelihood of their veracity being challenged Wikipedia s wiki link states that inline citations are required for any material challenged or likely to be challenged However to satisfy your niggling request I have added two more citations,0
